8/18/22, 11:05 - +44 7776 805049: Hi, my passport expires in May 2023 
Wanted to understand when should I ideally renew it, like how many months before, and if I can do it from london or should I do it in India when I plan to travel this December? 
Also if there’s any other things that might impact the renewal process that I need to do or take care of , e.g. BRP, UK visa etc? 
Thanks in advance!
8/18/22, 11:13 - +44 7547 160050: Hi we have a one huge bedroom available for short sublet in the heart of King's cross.

Dates: 22 August to 6th September 

5 min from King cross station.
suitable for single occupancy.

Cost 30 GBP per day (negotiable)
8/18/22, 11:42 - +44 7547 160050: females preferable

8/18/22, 12:02 - +44 7584 610611: Renewing it while travelling might be risky if there are delays in processing, unless u are staying in india for quite some time. 

Mine was also expiring in May 2023 and I recently got it renewed. There isn’t really a preferred time, u can do it whenever between 1 year before expiry and expiry. Imo earlier the better, cuz Visa applications require 6 months validity on ur passport.
8/18/22, 12:15 - +44 7557 478076: Hi, (to the sublet message), what are the available dates?
8/18/22, 12:19 - +91 88265 96173: +1 to what Aman said.
Just to add, there is usually waiting for passport renewal appointment and slots are not easily available. So even if you start now, it could easily take upto 2 months to get everything done in UK.
8/18/22, 12:19 - +44 7493 610517: 22nd august to 6th September
8/18/22, 12:22 - +44 7776 805049: Gotcha, thanks both!
8/18/22, 12:23 - +91 77740 86822: You can renew in India. Do tatkal and passport is dispatched on the same day of appointment. Police verification happens after receiving passport within 1 week. Tatkal service is Rs. 3500 (1500 pay during slot booking, 2000 pay on the appointment day on Counter A in cash)
8/18/22, 12:25 - +91 77740 86822: Oh yeah and police verification happens only if there are any particular changes like name, address. If there is no change, police verification won't happen.
8/18/22, 12:25 - +44 7776 805049: Thank you!
8/18/22, 12:26 - +91 88618 97183: I did this recently and even with no change police verification did happen
8/18/22, 12:26 - +91 88618 97183: But yes passport is in pretty fast
8/18/22, 12:28 - +44 7443 976019: I renewed it as mine was expiring soon too. Get it renewed before 6 months of expiry. Also are u planning to renew in London or India
8/18/22, 12:29 - +44 7776 805049: That’s what I was confused about, I am planning to go to India in November end 
So if before that I get an appointment in london, might as well do it here?
8/18/22, 12:30 - +44 7776 805049: I’ll be in india for 6 weeks
8/18/22, 12:31 - +44 7443 976019: There is like 2 moths delay in slot booking for London. Also if you apply in Tatkal in India, it is not guaranteed that they will proceed with it in tatkal. They do some internal check and if that check does not allow they might process it in normal. And for normal processing they guarantee 30 days for renew. I would say it is risky to do it in India
8/18/22, 12:32 - +44 7443 976019: And u cannot travel to any country except india with a validity of only 6 months left on ur passport
8/18/22, 12:39 - +91 88618 97183: Go for India. Passport renewal is fast
8/18/22, 12:39 - +91 88618 97183: But would you need a new visa and a new CoS?
8/18/22, 12:39 - +91 88618 97183: And how much time would thar take you might have to check that
8/18/22, 12:40 - +91 88618 97183: Also tatkaal slots get over a month in advance atleast in Mumbai Passport office so you might want to watch that
8/18/22, 12:53 - +91 96548 16991: Hi, I have a room available for sublet from 20th of August till 9th of September. Its located 2 mins away from East India station and walking distance to Canary Wharf. DM for more details.

8/18/22, 15:06 - +91 99875 77153: £100+ because you need to book an appointment with the third party VFS like vendor they have outsourced to. And I could not find any free slots.

8/18/22, 16:02 - +91 87268 14391: Your brp or passport should work

8/18/22, 16:17 - +91 98867 65648: Passport/BRP card is enough
8/18/22, 16:34 - +44 7450 031546: Did they ask for any important documents? Misplaced a lot of stuff 😅
8/18/22, 16:36 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Think it was just pics of passport and proof of address
8/18/22, 16:43 - +44 7405 420116: Resolved, thank you. Trainline is giving a good offer. Perhaps check it out.

I was missing the ‘<‘ thinking it wasn’t relevant when using my passport details.

Thanks all.
8/18/22, 16:46 - +91 98115 73710: Where would u use a special character like “<“?
Just curious

8/21/22, 09:03 - +91 99294 55503: I was talking to one HSBC guy for opening bank account in london. He mentioned that if I open my NRE account also in HSBC then money transfer will be very easy but if i transfer from HSBC to SBI then it might have some additional charges.

Can anyone share their thought on this ? If you have experience in cash transfer.
8/21/22, 09:08 - +44 7895 629636: Just use transferwise for money transfer, they are the cheapest. Banks are usually expensive.
8/21/22, 09:21 - +91 99357 01111: HSBC barclays rates are very low
8/21/22, 09:21 - +91 6387 547 833: In the same situation travelling LKO -> DEL -> LHR with Vistara.
You can leave the airport and need to find a place by your own

Please help me with these queries -

What is the best place to get a SIM card from? And what are some of the best prepaid plans?

Do I need to show my BRP to get the SIM card? Does it require an address or a bank account?
8/22/22, 13:15 - +44 7429 214883: You can get it from any store for £1
8/22/22, 13:15 - +44 7429 214883: You don't need anything to activate it xD
8/22/22, 13:16 - +91 80016 26675: You can get a sim from any general store like you get candy (much more economical than international roaming). Most networks will get you through the initial phase. You can do your research in the meanwhile to decide which network you want for the long term and buy another sim and discard the old one.

8/22/22, 15:44 - +91 80016 26675: esim support in UK network providers is garbage. honestly entire network industry here is garbage. Jio has kind of spoilt us all i guess. But no, very few network providers support esim, and many only support it on contracts a stuff. dont rely on it

8/22/22, 17:01 - +91 96168 84305: So in ur first year the only benefit is that ur yearly income received for that financial year would be less Nd so ur overall tax slab would be lower ..
Definitely a big save for ur bonus amounts.
8/22/22, 17:01 - +91 97180 83994: +1 🥲
8/22/22, 17:01 - +91 97180 83994: Best is to join in feb-march then 👀
8/22/22, 17:02 - +91 94552 22973: Should not the best time be september as you avoid paying double taxation as well
8/22/22, 17:02 - +91 97180 83994: CMIIW but then you'll have to pay tax for that in India 🙄
8/22/22, 17:03 - +91 97180 83994: Yeah anyhow you have to pay tax in one country
8/22/22, 17:03 - +91 97180 83994: Idk how it can be completely waived off

8/22/22, 17:07 - +91 80061 33666: A friend living in London told me this so thought of confirming here.
8/22/22, 17:07 - +91 80061 33666: hmm yeah
8/22/22, 17:19 - +91 80016 26675: Your financial year starts when you enter the country. Anything you earned back in india is not taxed (search for split financial year). Other than that I am not aware of any tax incentives
8/22/22, 18:20 - +44 7398 191815: Arrived in uk recently, but i have hurt my hand and want to get it checked. Can anyone tell whats the procedure to get it checked in NHS?
8/22/22, 18:21 - +44 7398 191815: Im mot registered with a GP yet
8/22/22, 18:22 - +44 7879 996571: You can go to A&E (Emergency) of any NHS hospital
8/22/22, 18:22 - +44 7879 996571: There’s a wait but they’ll see without GP registration
8/22/22, 18:23 - +44 7398 191815: Ohh okay! How long is the wait usually?
8/22/22, 18:24 - +44 7879 996571: There’s a line usually, evenings will be busier I think
8/22/22, 18:24 - +44 7879 996571: Can be 1-2 hours sometimes
8/22/22, 18:24 - +44 7398 191815: Ohh okay, thank you!
8/22/22, 18:26 - +44 7398 191815: A&E service works even when its past hospital closing time right?
8/22/22, 18:27 - +44 7879 996571: Should I think
8/22/22, 18:27 - +44 7879 996571: Can call them to check
8/22/22, 18:29 - +91 98844 88154: If you spend more than 183 days in a financial year in the uk, you'll have to pay tax on your Indian income as well
8/22/22, 18:31 - +91 73879 00750: Isn’t there a DTAA between india and the UK?
8/22/22, 18:33 - +91 80016 26675: Not in the year that you move here. I am pretty sure about it. The year you move here for settlement, you have a split financial year.

But yes, a good catch here is that you should spend more than 183 days in the UK, if under that, u r an indian tax resident and i am not sure how the treatment is in that case
8/22/22, 18:50 - +91 98208 88583: Go to royal london hospital in whitechappel and get urself examined. Even if u are not registered with gp. It will take 4-5 hours of waiting but emergency service will accomodate u
8/22/22, 18:53 - +44 7429 214883: Go through your company's insurance if you have one
8/22/22, 18:53 - +44 7429 214883: NHS will take forever
8/22/22, 18:56 - +91 98208 88583: Yeah

8/22/22, 18:59 - +91 98208 88583: Yeah but NHS also serves on emergency cases pretty fast
8/22/22, 19:00 - +44 7429 214883: I guess, but there's a good chance they won't treat it as an emergency
8/22/22, 19:00 - +44 7429 214883: But yeah
8/22/22, 19:01 - +91 98208 88583: I agree their defination of emergency maybe different
8/22/22, 19:02 - +91 96168 84305: I was stuck in a bad situation with wrist injury.. NHS Nd even private appointment can be frustrating.

I suggest going to closest A&E for initial diagnosis.. atleast u can get X-ray examined the same day.

8/23/22, 18:37 - +91 77740 86822: I mean the issue is with their website. My immigration provider gave me this reponse 

the priority services are now available, however, we are currently having issues with the priority service being available for dependants. We have confirmation from the Home Office that dependants should have access to priority service, however, it seems there is a glitch in the Home Office system which has not yet been resolved.

8/24/22, 13:35 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: Will need a bank account pretty quickly after I land. My employer rolls out salaries on 25th of each month. I’ll be joining in 19th. 

Don’t know if there will be enough time to get an account after I land.
8/24/22, 13:35 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: Is it suitable for receiving salaries and stuff?
8/24/22, 13:36 - +91 99357 01111: Subjective. I dont even consider monzo for salaries
8/24/22, 13:36 - +91 88275 24158: Feel free to give my account details for salary deposit 👍

8/24/22, 13:51 - +91 90133 32219: Does anybody have experience with Chase account? I will have another account for salary purpose, so want to keep this one for spends (Monzo or Chase)..any reviews?
8/24/22, 13:52 - +91 73845 65500: It won't work ig. I used my temporary acco pin code. It says they can't offer an account until i have a registered uk address. Donno how do they check that
8/24/22, 13:55 - +44 7385 957410: Chase is better by a huge margin
8/24/22, 14:00 - +44 7450 031546: Any way to download the chase app without changing the region to Uk in AppStore?
8/24/22, 14:00 - +44 7385 957410: I don't think so
8/24/22, 14:02 - +91 77740 86822: How is ICICI uk?

8/24/22, 14:03 - +91 78939 08982: If I'm not mistaken, most companies might not give you your salary for the first month if you join after the first two or three weeks of the month.
8/24/22, 14:04 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: I confirmed with mine. They said they will give a prorated amount for the month.
8/24/22, 14:07 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: Do I also need a UK phone number to open a Monzo account, or does an Indian one work?

8/24/22, 14:43 - +91 98200 68716: Can I do Revolut rn with my Indian phone number and change it later to the UK number once I move there?
8/24/22, 14:51 - +91 90995 33706: I'm still running it on my india phone number and it works fine, I think you should be able to change it if you need too. However make sure you enter a UK address when you enroll, otherwise for an Indian address it will just put you in the India waitlist.
8/24/22, 15:03 - +91 97926 75119: Does the UK employers not help with setting up of the salary bank account?
8/24/22, 15:05 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: I guess it depends on the employer.
8/24/22, 15:05 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: Mine doesn’t. Maybe yours does.

8/24/22, 15:36 - +91 90995 33706: Salary account setups can sometimes take upto a week or more. It's better to have an online bank setup before you reach because you will anyway be barely using cash.
8/24/22, 15:37 - +91 73794 18882: Which bank is good ? Any suggestions
8/24/22, 15:39 - +91 90995 33706: Online? Revolut or Wise, set it up from India itself

8/24/22, 15:44 - +91 90995 33706: You can use a temporary address, I used the service apartment address the company assigned me in advance. You can also use a friend's address if there are folks here already.
8/24/22, 15:44 - +91 94552 22973: Will it let us change the address later?

Moving date somewhere around Mid to End-September
8/24/22, 18:12 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: Can vouch for it. The place looked great!
8/24/22, 18:22 - +91 87623 99909: My partner is submitting docs for the skilled worker visa and Fragomen is asking to submit an English lang requirement. We see a list of approved tests and centres like IELTS, Pearson, PSI, etc. Can someone please suggest if there's any quicker test they have taken from this list of tests? Currently based in Hyderabad.
8/24/22, 18:23 - +91 77740 86822: I gave thru Pearson. Got the results by the time I reached home. This was in Pune, although center should not make any difference.
8/24/22, 18:23 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: The simplest way is to get your college degree certified by ECCTIS.
They will need their degree and a medium of instruction letter from their college stating their degree was taught in english. Submit that to ECCTIS, pay their fee (you can also opt for express service), and you'll get their certification in a few days.
8/24/22, 18:24 - +91 87623 99909: Many thanks for this. Will check for Pearson in Hyd as well
8/24/22, 18:25 - +91 80061 33666: what was the fee for ECCTIS?
8/24/22, 18:25 - +971 56 827 7309 joined using this group's invite link
8/24/22, 18:25 - +44 7429 214883: Yeah I gave Pearson too, you'll get the result in a day
8/24/22, 18:25 - Anirudh Mittal: You can check the next available date for each of these tests and choose whichever is available at the earliest. The result time for each time is on their website for comparison. It doesn't take that long but can be used for choosing the test.
8/24/22, 18:25 - +91 87623 99909: Unfortunately my Uni takes more than two weeks to send me the medium of instruction cert. Hence looking for alternatives
8/24/22, 18:25 - +91 77740 86822: Almost Same as the english test. Around 14k.
8/24/22, 18:32 - +91 77740 86822: Pearson test is done in 90 mins in one sitting. Not sure about others. I was initially trying PSI coz of earlier availability but their payment gateway is shitty, my transaction failed and it got stuck there and I could not book another since the website was assuming transaction is pending. Mailed the tech support and they took 3 days to reply. So avoid PSI if you can.
8/24/22, 18:47 - +91 87623 99909: Thank you all for quick responses. Seems like Pearson is the easy and quick one to take. May I please know if this is the right test to take - https://www.pearsonpte.com/selt-tests/pte-academic-ukvi
8/24/22, 18:48 - +91 87623 99909: I've asked the Fargomen agent as well for confirmation on this particular test. But I guess we'll go ahead with this one
8/24/22, 19:00 - +91 77740 86822: Correct
8/24/22, 19:01 - +91 80061 33666: Do we need any preparation to give this test ?
8/24/22, 19:03 - +91 77740 86822: There is sample material on the website. No preparation needed as such just see the material to get an idea on how the questions will be asked.
8/24/22, 19:06 - +91 80061 33666: thanks

8/25/22, 07:39 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: Did anyone here hold investments in Mutual Funds in India before they moved to London?
Did you liquidate those investments, or did you leave them as is?
8/25/22, 07:46 - +91 97293 85331: Leave them as is. I was told to inform the AMC about the move but you can do it in coming months as well no hard restrictions.
Some companies don’t allow NRIs to invest (like Payton money) so you need to contact AMC directly for future sips
8/25/22, 07:46 - +91 97293 85331: But again nothing urgent before you leave, it’s chill you can leave it for 6+ months as is and it will be ok
8/25/22, 07:47 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: Maybe a stupid question, but what's AMC?
8/25/22, 07:47 - +91 97293 85331: Asset management company
8/25/22, 07:47 - +91 97293 85331: Every Mf has one
8/25/22, 07:48 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: Right. I've invested through the Groww app into 5 different funds. Would my AMC be Groww, or would it be every individual MF?
8/25/22, 07:49 - +91 97293 85331: Groww is most likely not managing the mf money , though better check your mf page for more details
8/25/22, 07:49 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: Will do. Thanks!
8/25/22, 07:51 - +91 97560 31125: But money already kept in Mf would not be impacted, right? What if we continue our Sip from UK through Indian Bank account
8/25/22, 07:52 - +91 88618 97183: Groww is your broker
8/25/22, 07:52 - +91 88618 97183: AMC title would be present in the MF nme
8/25/22, 07:52 - +91 88618 97183: Name**
8/25/22, 07:52 - +91 97293 85331: Yes no one will do anything to the money don’t worry
8/25/22, 07:53 - +91 98454 02990: Is there tax on notional gains in MFs ?
8/25/22, 07:54 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: The main point of confusion for me was the presence of an extra bank account through Groww.
Once you've transitioned to an NRI status, all your accounts in India must either be NRE/NRO, as far as I understand. Groww forces you to create a Demat account, and I don't know how to transition it to NRE/NRO.

Money invested in Mutual Funds is not related to the demat account though, so it probably shouldn't be impacted. As long as your gains are not realized, you shouldn't be taxed IMO.

(not a lawyer or a financial advisor, so use heaps of skepticism on this info)
8/25/22, 08:19 - +91 87569 96900: I personally opted for furnished just because of the convenience but I think if you want an estimate of how much it might cost, take a look at the prices of the basics (bed, wardrobe etc) on ikea UK? It is also worth remembering that you’ll either need to dispose of this stuff/be responsible for moving or storing it when your tenancy ends so that might be a pain.
8/25/22, 08:35 - +44 7721 549487: Thanks 👍🏻

If anyone is interested in looking for flats with me please pm.
8/25/22, 08:40 - +91 96389 52451: I think there are NRE/NRO Demat accounts as well. Usually nothing happens, but legally you are supposed to convert your Demat to NRE/NRO account which requires NRE/NRO bank account in the first place.
8/25/22, 09:12 - +91 73794 18882: Any girl in this group moving nearby to central london around end of October ?

2. My phone supports eSIM. Is there an eSIM i can get online from India and use it in the UK(again economical/decent network)?

Thank you :)
8/25/22, 11:59 - +91 86690 91448: You can get giffgaff. I'm on EE but their app sucks. Try Lyca network instead
8/25/22, 11:59 - +91 86690 91448: Giffgaff is pretty good from what I've heard so far
8/25/22, 11:59 - +44 7940 156531: Convert your Indian sim to esim before moving

8/25/22, 12:02 - +44 7940 156531: For data yeah you'd need international roaming
8/25/22, 12:03 - +91 97799 44247: And what about good recharge so that we can also work for office on hotspot🥲🥲

8/25/22, 14:31 - +91 87569 96900: Yall, when you rented a house/flat, did they ask u for upfront rent or a guarantor if u were on probation?
8/25/22, 14:32 - +91 87569 96900: My friend’s on probation for 6 months and they’re asking for either a guarantor or 6 months rent upfront which is a lot
8/25/22, 14:35 - +44 7584 943531: Yeah, they usually do that if you're on probation x
8/25/22, 14:37 - +44 7584 943531: It is quite a lot so you could either go for some landlord who is happy with proof of funds i.e bank statements and offer letter. 
Usually agents are a pain so it's best if you can avoid it!
8/25/22, 14:38 - +44 7584 943531: Telling them you don't have a guarantor upfront makes them a bit hesitant to offer you the flat :(
8/25/22, 14:46 - +91 81469 21067: probation?
8/25/22, 14:47 - +91 81469 21067: relation to prison?
8/25/22, 14:47 - +91 81469 21067: or job related probation?
8/25/22, 14:48 - +44 7584 943531: Its usually at the start of an employment in some roles - when you can be dismissed with little or no notice if you're found unsuitable for the role
8/25/22, 14:48 - +91 81469 21067: ok cool makes sense then 🤔
8/25/22, 14:49 - +44 7584 943531: It should be in your contract 
If not, you don't need a guarantor
8/25/22, 14:49 - +91 87569 96900: Hopefully not

I have my flight on first and I am yet to receive my visa. 

I had done a priority one. last Saturday appointment was there. So it’s been about 7 days (5 working days)  now.
8/28/22, 00:09 - +91 98208 88583: Looks difficult as there a long weekend in london so mostly it will resume services on 30th aug.
8/28/22, 00:09 - +91 98208 88583: There is a uk telephone no which is chargeable u can try that but still it will be out of office as everyone is on long weekend here
8/28/22, 00:16 - +91 94390 94370: Oh deum!!!👀🥲
8/28/22, 00:16 - +91 94390 94370: So these visa works are done in London?
8/28/22, 00:17 - +91 87268 14391: Long weekend is in UK
8/28/22, 00:17 - +91 94390 94370: Does the passport go to UK and come back? Or it’s stamped and returned within india only? 
Just curious
8/28/22, 00:17 - +91 98208 88583: Yeah to some extent as the approvals are sent from london as the background verification is done by india team. Once the approval comes printing happens in india (maybe)
8/28/22, 00:18 - +91 94390 94370: Hmm okay
8/28/22, 00:18 - +91 94390 94370: Ahh I see
8/28/22, 00:18 - +91 94390 94370: Okay will give that a try.
8/28/22, 00:18 - +91 98208 88583: No sure on that one. But maybe printing happens in india else the visa cost would be much higher to send the passport to uk
8/28/22, 00:19 - +91 98208 88583: Yeah there will ask for ur credit card details first and on successful verification connect ur call
8/28/22, 00:20 - +91 94390 94370: Hm okay.
8/28/22, 00:20 - +91 94390 94370: Thanks for your insights Husein!
8/28/22, 00:24 - +91 98208 88583: No probs. I suggest have a backup plan for ur airfare else last minute it will be a huge cost as priority services at ukvi is also taking time.
8/28/22, 00:51 - +91 94390 94370: Hmm 
Duly noted. I ll check out what can be done. Perhaps a flight reschedule from now will be a safer option.
8/28/22, 00:51 - +91 94390 94370: I’ll check with UK visa office over a call to know the status:
8/28/22, 00:53 - +91 98208 88583: Yeah probably take an option of another 15-20 days would help as i hv not heard of any cases where visa has arrived ealier than 15 days from date of application under any category
8/28/22, 01:20 - +91 94390 94370: Ohhh!! 

Someone was telling though that they got their visa in about 5 days in the priority category..
Let me check with them.. will keep you posted
8/28/22, 01:23 - +91 94390 94370: But yea for safe side it makes sense to postpone the flight

8/29/22, 08:14 - +91 98200 68716: I’m travelling long-distance for the first time via flight, is a day flight advisable or a night flight always significantly convenient? (Mumbai to London). Also how is Virgin Atlantic?
8/29/22, 08:37 - +91 94390 94370: Is there an email id to which I can write to expedite the visa processing by any chance?
8/29/22, 08:38 - +91 94390 94370: The VFS people tracked and told that the process is at the embassy now.
8/29/22, 08:38 - +91 94390 94370: I have booked my tickets of 1st sept 

So.. hmm..
8/29/22, 08:39 - +91 94390 94370: Idk what to do exactly 

I had gone for a priority visa 

Appointment was on 20th. It’s been 8 days now..
8/29/22, 08:39 - +91 77740 86822: You can’t expedite the process. Can only enquire.
8/29/22, 08:41 - +91 97178 23927: Ideally you should get the visa tomorrow as 5 working days completed on 26 Aug and today is UK holiday.
8/29/22, 08:41 - +91 77740 86822: Check with your immigration partner if they can do anything
8/29/22, 08:49 - +91 94390 94370: Ohh hmm heard that it’s a holiday
8/29/22, 08:49 - +91 94390 94370: You mean the VFS office folks?
8/29/22, 08:50 - +91 77740 86822: No your immigration company like Fragomen, Deloitte
8/29/22, 08:51 - +91 94390 94370: Hmm how do I know that??
8/29/22, 08:51 - +91 77740 86822: Student or work visa?
8/29/22, 08:52 - +91 97178 23927: if you're a student and you've filled your application on your own then you wouldn’t have one
8/29/22, 08:52 - +91 94390 94370: Student visa
8/29/22, 08:52 - +91 94390 94370: Yes I filed on my own 

Basially the VFS office person did it for me quickly in the office
8/29/22, 11:01 - +91 90878 58510: Which airlines give maximum luggage allowance? 
I believe checkin luggage is 2*23kgs for all but cabin luggage varies.
8/29/22, 11:02 - +91 94286 61452: vistara
8/29/22, 11:02 - +44 7767 959819: Umm for Vistara, it is 3*23kgs for students 
One laptop bag and one 7kg cabin luggage
8/29/22, 11:02 - +91 94286 61452: i had 32X2
8/29/22, 11:02 - +91 94286 61452: economy flexi
8/29/22, 11:03 - +44 7767 959819: This was economy (standard)
8/29/22, 11:03 - +91 94286 61452: if you request your travel partner they will book it since the difference is not that much
8/29/22, 11:04 - +44 7767 959819: Yeah also i was able to get an extra bag of 23Kgs for half the actual extra baggage cost
8/29/22, 11:12 - +91 90878 58510: Thank you.. Did you one fly with british airways?
8/29/22, 11:15 - +44 7951 853596: Yes, you get 2*32 kgs plus 2*23 kgs for BA business class.
8/29/22, 11:25 - +44 7429 214883: No you get a 6 months visa
8/29/22, 11:25 - +44 7429 214883: They can stay up to 6 months. Should be fine
8/29/22, 11:28 - +91 77740 86822: For BA business, its 2*32+23 cabin+23 laptop
8/29/22, 11:28 - +44 7903 678132: Has anyone applied for a Schengen visa using the Uk e-work visa? I switched from tier 4 to tier 2 visa and apparently they don't issue physical BRP's if one switches from tier 4 to tier 2 work visa using the UK ID Immigration check app
8/29/22, 11:30 - +91 90878 58510: Is it the same for BA economy?
8/29/22, 11:31 - +44 7767 959887: Yep
8/29/22, 11:31 - +91 77740 86822: 2*23 instead of 32 for economic https://www.britishairways.com/en-in/information/baggage-essentials
8/29/22, 11:31 - +1 (408) 504-5011: Hmmmm I don't think so. Limit for check in is 23kg for economy
8/29/22, 11:32 - +91 77740 86822: No, 2*23 for economy instead of 32
8/29/22, 11:33 - +44 7767 959887: Oh sorry my bad, I read that as 23
8/29/22, 11:33 - +91 90878 58510: Yes, checkin is 2*23 but will cabin baggage be still 23 + 23 for laptop on case of economy?
8/29/22, 11:41 - +91 98338 07887: https://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/information/baggage-essentials/checked-baggage-allowances

Just put your source and destination here and it'll show what's the allowance for that route
8/29/22, 11:42 - +91 98338 07887: It's 2*23 check in and then 2*23 carry on
But the laptop bag dimensions are smaller (not sure if they check it, they didn't for me)
8/29/22, 11:46 - +91 90878 58510: Thanks

Last time I went there, they were doing proper Ganesh pooja as part of aarti. I am guessing they will be having something nice for Ganesh Chaturthi as well
8/31/22, 14:38 - +44 7767 959845: I have a large room available in Canada Water from 1october for 4months. River-view flat. Rent 1050 including bills. Please message me directly if you’re interested. Thanks!
8/31/22, 15:06 - +91 98208 88583: Yes there is a ram mandir and lots of guruduwara in southall
8/31/22, 15:11 - +91 98208 88583: Elizabeth line is the recent one to be introduced this summer and has ac compartments compared to central or dlr lines. Fast and marginally expensive.
8/31/22, 15:12 - +91 98208 88583: I read today there has been vote for upgrading piccadilly line for £2.9 billion
8/31/22, 15:42 - +91 96168 84305: <Media omitted>
8/31/22, 15:42 - +91 96168 84305: near Wimbledon

8/31/22, 16:16 - +91 97110 90746: Will there be Prasad?
8/31/22, 17:42 - +44 7895 629636: I think its not much useful before phase 2 is open, since you need to change at Paddington for Heathrow, and its a long change. But after that, definitely yes. Much more comfortable and direct trains to Startford/canary wharf. Marginally expensive but you get 33% off using rail card.
8/31/22, 17:51 - +91 88275 24158: True. Ajeeb si chubhne wali awaz nhi ati Elizabeth me
8/31/22, 17:51 - +91 88275 24158: <Media omitted>
8/31/22, 17:59 - +91 70302 21187: Okay..
So I am looking at this line for travelling from farringdon to canary wharf or further away east side..  
I am looking for a flat and if this line is good and fast perhaps looking at areas like woolwich etc makes sense as travel time will still be less than 30 minutes
8/31/22, 18:08 - +91 81789 64398: How many days will it take to get Niyo global card delivered?

8/31/22, 18:24 - +91 81789 64398: Ohkay thanks ✌️
8/31/22, 18:25 - +91 81789 64398: Actually on app it is showing around 8-9 days
8/31/22, 18:42 - +91 94286 61452: this 33% off works when you connect oyster with railcard right?
8/31/22, 18:44 - +91 99357 01111: Yes
8/31/22, 18:45 - +91 96430 78710: Isn't that only for off peak hours?
8/31/22, 18:53 - +91 86748 07262: Can the linking be done online? I searched online and found that this needs to be done at the tube station by a clerk or someone.
8/31/22, 18:57 - +44 7436 935142: Yeah you need to do it at an underground station
8/31/22, 18:57 - +91 86748 07262: Oh ok, thanks for confirming 😊
8/31/22, 18:57 - +91 83710 32232: Is there anyone whose tax code changed to K582 M1?

8/31/22, 19:29 - +91 99357 01111: It is
8/31/22, 20:22 - +91 96030 24199: Are you married or living with partner?
8/31/22, 21:02 - +91 97180 83994: Does Revolut bank statements work for Schengen Visa applications?

8/31/22, 21:10 - +91 98115 73710: 9:30 i guess*
8/31/22, 21:10 - +91 98208 88583: It can be done from any shops near the stations or off license places
8/31/22, 21:11 - +91 94286 61452: yeah but not online 😅
8/31/22, 21:11 - +91 98208 88583: I read it was 9am but maybe 9.30 then
8/31/22, 21:11 - +91 98208 88583: Yes of course
9/1/22, 05:51 - +91 99168 56892: Is it recommended to buy forex from India before travelling to UK? (Particularly now that £1 is 92 only )
9/1/22, 06:12 - +91 94552 22973: +1
Also, Is it recommended to get it from sites like bookmyforex or get a regular bank’s forex?
9/1/22, 06:25 - +91 99294 55503: Just one advice , dont bring much cash as cash is not accepted very widely here.
9/1/22, 06:26 - +91 99294 55503: just check with both of them and who so ever is offering less price take from them.
9/1/22, 06:27 - +91 97178 23927: Does anyone know if Niyo card is accepted in Uber?
9/1/22, 06:33 - +91 94552 22973: Do landlords accept forex card/ niyo ?
9/1/22, 06:37 - +91 99168 56892: Cash not accepted, really ?
9/1/22, 06:39 - +91 99294 55503: We were trying to book uber from airport it dint accept cash.
The desk cab on airport accepted it.
While ordering food from app it dint accept.
Dominos outlet dint accept.
One grocery store accepted.
9/1/22, 06:41 - +91 88618 97183: For emergency maybe just carry 500 pounds or is that too much also?
9/1/22, 06:41 - +91 99168 56892: Okk
9/1/22, 06:44 - +91 99294 55503: We are two so we carried 1000
9/1/22, 06:47 - +91 99873 71355: Did anyone linked it with paytm?
9/1/22, 06:55 - +44 7429 214883: They'll probably accept it for the  security deposit. But not for the rent. 
these cards have some 2-3% fees for the merchant, that's why they don't accept it
9/1/22, 06:56 - +91 94552 22973: Makes sense. I was talking about deposit only
9/1/22, 07:18 - +91 78060 35817: How early should one come to london before their joining date? Are 3-4 days enough to get the necessary documents and get used to basic stuff?
9/1/22, 07:20 - +91 88618 97183: I've booked 6 days prior for my joining in October 4
9/1/22, 07:28 - +91 93764 94643: I will come one day prior to joining. will that be okay?
9/1/22, 07:30 - +44 7990 337141: - Niyo forex card has the best rates

- Cash is good for backup, but cards work everywhere (including public transport). Carried 500 pounds cash, barely used anything.

- Recommend getting a Revolut bank account, which you can open from india with visa… borrow pounds from someone you know in Uk and return after the first salary - that’s easiest to avoid any transaction charges and use with convenience. Works well with Apple Pay. If you need a physical card for free (which is otherwise 5 gbp), use can choose to use my referral (or not): https://revolut.com/referral/sunajei40i!SEP1-22-AR

Either ways, this information is unbiased cause it was super helpful to me

9/1/22, 08:54 - +91 87268 14391: Yes, you need to select your cycle and any accessories you want to buy. Get a voucher of the total value from your company and just give that voucher in Decathlon
9/1/22, 09:10 - +91 84476 90195: Hello! 
Has someone in the group ever dealt with 'PurpleBricks' Estate agents ?
9/1/22, 09:10 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: Thanks. It's not specific to electric bikes, right?
9/1/22, 09:11 - +91 87268 14391: I'm not sure if it applies to electric bikes
9/1/22, 09:11 - +91 87268 14391: You should check on the website
9/1/22, 09:12 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: Thanks, will do.

AFAIK it does apply to electric bikes. Most of the info I read was so focused on e-bikes that I assumed it was for e-bikes only!
9/1/22, 11:04 - +91 83710 32232: No, I'm not. It seems a mistake might have to contact pwc or hmrc to get it corrected I guess 😅
9/1/22, 11:39 - +91 94092 58684: does anyone know if we need to carry like original 10th 12th marksheets, pan card, birth certi etc with us?

9/1/22, 11:54 - +91 97737 59478: Anyone living near mornington place,NW1  area or has any reviews about it ,please dm!
9/1/22, 12:06 - +91 78792 79478: It would probably be due to GSUs vesting
9/1/22, 12:07 - +91 78792 79478: *RSUs
9/1/22, 12:11 - +91 83710 32232: May be, I contacted hmrc regarding this, they mistakenly estimated my income to be over 200k which led to this tax code. It's been corrected now.
9/1/22, 12:13 - +91 78792 79478: Ohh great, how did you contacted them?
I have the same tax code, someone told me it's due to RSUs so I didn't bothered till now
9/1/22, 12:15 - +91 83710 32232: Hmrc contact: 03002003300
9/1/22, 12:15 - +91 78792 79478: Thanks!
9/1/22, 12:17 - +91 83710 32232: Depends on person, may be its fine if there is no excess tax deduction.

9/1/22, 13:44 - +91 86978 18442: Just clarifying -80 right? So if you give someone a pound, they ask for 80₹ extra
9/1/22, 13:45 - +91 96545 88845: This will touch 85 soonest but not 80.
This is all due to GBP is declining against the USD ( reason US sucks with their policies wherein they eat the cream and let other suffer, similarly happening in Russia-Ukrain war )
9/1/22, 13:47 - +91 97180 83994: Wo din door nahi 🥲😭
9/1/22, 13:47 - +91 97178 23927: So disheartening for people looking to move and have some savings parked in India🥲

9/1/22, 13:48 - +91 97180 83994: But should have transferred 100% 🥺

9/1/22, 13:59 - +91 89494 46145: Hi, I am looking for recommendations of deep cleaning service providers. TIA.
9/1/22, 14:02 - +91 86978 18442: Fed has been quite hawkish in its stance against inflation, but BoE has not been so. But it'll probably get better soon. That should bring us back to 95. Not seeing pound at 85 anytime soon. Also this is investors being reactive, it should stabilize soon.
9/1/22, 14:03 - +91 91483 10096: <Media omitted>

9/1/22, 14:38 - +91 98200 68716: I just created a Revolut account, I was trying to verify my account details via iban.com, my calculated IBAN from iban.com is different from the one I can see in my Revolut app. Which is the correct one?

9/1/22, 14:44 - +1 (226) 792-6466: And it gets replaced as a physical sim, so someone needs to help you get it replaced to esim too
9/1/22, 15:04 - +91 81469 21067: Where did you went to convert?
9/1/22, 15:05 - +91 99168 56892: True.

Anything is okay with just some very basic amenities.
9/1/22, 15:31 - +91 94390 94370: Simple Cheap rooms with safety of the luggages I keep.
9/1/22, 15:33 - +44 7429 214883: No such thing as cheap accommodations in London 😂
9/1/22, 15:50 - +91 94552 22973: Is it because I am still in india?
9/1/22, 15:57 - +91 98208 88583: Yes u will need to provide immigration stamp on ur visa to ensure ur entry in uk
9/1/22, 15:57 - +91 94552 22973: Hmm. I suspected that. So basically there is no way to open uk account without entering uk
9/1/22, 16:04 - +91 98200 68716: I just opened one in 10 mins while in India
9/1/22, 16:05 - +91 94552 22973: You don’t have a immigration stamp?
9/1/22, 16:05 - +91 98200 68716: Nope

9/1/22, 16:24 - +91 98208 88583: Yes
9/1/22, 16:26 - +91 98208 88583: I dont think anything would be cheaper than bolt else u can try national rail for going to any particular place. But that could he a little tiring as carrying ur luggage and changing trains may be a prob
9/1/22, 16:27 - +91 94552 22973: Just out of curiosity, how much uber/bolt costs to reach central london from heathrow?

9/1/22, 16:42 - +91 98208 88583: U need to create a bolt account and select online payment and link ur niyo account under payment method. At end of your trip the amount would be deducted from ur account.
9/1/22, 16:43 - +91 73845 65500: At the start of your trip*👻
9/1/22, 16:43 - +91 73387 98208: Yeah i was facing difficulties linking card in uber
9/1/22, 16:43 - +91 98208 88583: Of course everything has to be done in advance in uk.

9/2/22, 11:12 - +91 99168 56892: Has anyone heard of it ? Seems fake, too good to be true but let me know if anyone is aware of
9/2/22, 11:17 - +91 84476 90195: Has anyone got an Airtel sim re-issued in London?
9/2/22, 11:25 - +44 7869 270548: There is one potential solution:
1. Get it transferred to someone in your blood relation (requesting it using your registered email id with any proof they ask for, should work)
2. Ask that person to get a physical SIM in India from an Airtel store
3. Ask them to send a message using that new SIM to convert it to an eSIM
4. Use the QR code here in London to add the eSIM to your phone

step 1 was mentioned to me by an airtel store executive, haven't tried it personally... IF you do, kindly let me know if it works or not
9/2/22, 11:38 - +91 98338 07887: 1st step works, they do MNP and Don't check previous SIM owners name,
9/2/22, 11:38 - +44 7869 270548: MNP?

Thanks!

Is this just for Airtel?

eSIM is such a mess
9/2/22, 16:17 - +44 7385 957410: An easier option is to get the UK number converted to esim
9/2/22, 16:17 - +91 99328 26235: I got my Airtel SIM converted to an eSIM while in London. Don't actually remember the steps.
9/2/22, 16:18 - +44 7869 270548: I have Three, they don't do eSIMs

I think Lebara doesn't either
9/2/22, 16:19 - +44 7869 270548: But how would you get it reissued this way?

I remember you can't get eSIM from an eSIM. You must get a physical sim first if you ever delete eSIM or want to switch phones
9/2/22, 16:20 - +91 99328 26235: I had a physical SIM
9/2/22, 16:21 - +1 (226) 792-6466: i did this

9/2/22, 16:21 - +1 (226) 792-6466: I think we had to wait 24 hours to get the new eSim but that's it
9/2/22, 16:21 - +44 7869 270548: I've done that part too but not the transfer thing
9/2/22, 16:22 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Didn't have to transfer either, the new sims are still in my name too

9/3/22, 04:59 - +91 98992 69029: What jio pack is best suited to ensure that the number continues to be under my name and I receive all message updates in UK?
9/3/22, 05:06 - +91 97178 23927: Same question for Airtel? 
I just want to keep receiving text messages for OTPs
9/3/22, 05:26 - +91 86978 18442: The 15k pack is nice but it's more than just receiving
9/3/22, 06:24 - +91 99168 56892: Airtel told me that sim works in the uk without opting for any plans - like any prepaid number .
9/3/22, 06:24 - +91 99168 56892: Is this true ?
9/3/22, 06:38 - +91 95478 29283: Anyone has opened account with induslnd bank?
9/3/22, 06:48 - +91 99168 56892: Do we really have to opt for any plans to just continue getting OTPs?
9/3/22, 07:08 - +91 73845 65500: You dont need any packs. Just come here and switch jio network to o2. They provide paygo rates (pay as you use kinda)
9/3/22, 07:12 - +91 77740 86822: Same with Airtel?
9/3/22, 07:19 - +91 73845 65500: Yep it auto switched. Just before coming here send IRSTART to 121
9/3/22, 07:20 - +91 73845 65500: That's it. I just don't use them n only use it when there is some otp requirements 😂
9/3/22, 08:07 - +91 77740 86822: Do you do something every time when receiving otp?
9/3/22, 08:13 - +91 73845 65500: Nope nothing 🤡
9/3/22, 09:11 - +91 96860 55337: I have Airtel. I keep doing a recharge of 109 every month.  Enough for receiving SMS.
9/3/22, 09:11 - +91 99873 71355: What about calls?
9/3/22, 09:11 - +91 84485 10993: Did you get any international roaming pack or sthg before leaving India?
9/3/22, 09:12 - +91 96860 55337: No incoming or outgoing calls, data, etc. Your number stays active and only incoming SMS. That's it.
9/3/22, 09:12 - +91 96860 55337: Nope. Don't have any special package. Normal Airtel recharge
9/3/22, 09:12 - +91 84485 10993: Cool thanks
9/3/22, 09:13 - +91 99873 71355: And for calls did you issue e sim or what?
9/3/22, 09:13 - +91 96860 55337: I use UK sim for calls
9/3/22, 09:13 - +91 99873 71355: Old
9/3/22, 09:13 - +91 99873 71355: Okay **
9/3/22, 09:15 - +91 97180 83994: Jio is free for messages....For receiving calls its 1101₹ a month.
9/3/22, 09:19 - +91 93764 94643: only for receiving?
9/3/22, 09:30 - +91 97180 83994: You get balance as well so you can use that to call in India
9/3/22, 09:32 - +91 94092 58684: anyone using bsnl?

9/3/22, 10:58 - +91 84990 66600: I do and its really nice
9/3/22, 11:04 - +44 7442 603575: Check your tenant contract, there should be a clause related to it.
9/3/22, 11:05 - +91 99168 56892: OK
9/3/22, 11:05 - +91 99168 56892: Do the usual agreements bar the existing tenants to further sublet (or you can say let their friends stay temporarily)?
9/3/22, 11:13 - +91 96168 84305: I have seen clauses mentioning how long friends can stay over a given period of time.
9/3/22, 11:23 - +91 99168 56892: Ok
9/3/22, 14:19 - +91 97180 83994: Is this an IR pack? 😮
9/3/22, 14:40 - +91 74163 03635: Hello All, If i join in the company December this year, will the UK tax bracket computes based on only Dec-March salary? Or do i have to declare indian salary and tax slab will be higher?
9/3/22, 15:12 - +91 77740 86822: Why? Haven’t you already paid tax for your indian salary
9/3/22, 15:14 - +91 74163 03635: Yes..i have paid and will reflect in ITR..but if i declare that to UK company, total income will come to higher slabs..that is the query..
9/3/22, 15:19 - +91 98208 88583: Y will u pay tax in uk for india salary. Uk is not bothered what u earn outside uk. U pay india earned salary in india and uk earning tax in uk. Unless u r in the same co or taking transfer i dont think it should be a prob
9/3/22, 15:21 - +91 74163 03635: So...UK tax slab will be determined based on Dec,2022 to March,2023 income?
9/3/22, 15:27 - +44 7429 214883: Yeah
9/3/22, 15:28 - +44 7429 214883: But you might have to declare that income in India, and probably pay taxes in India because the tax on 3 months salary will be less
9/3/22, 15:28 - +44 7429 214883: I'm not sure about this tho
9/3/22, 15:30 - +91 97178 23927: Most likely yes, there will be double taxation if you work in India for more than 183 days and rest in UK, as you’ll be considered Indian citizen for that financial year. Any income earned outside UK will be considered foreign income w.r.t. UK and you’ll have to pay taxes accordingly. 
Check with tax advisor if your company provides one.
9/3/22, 15:32 - +91 74163 03635: So double taxation will be refunded later?
9/3/22, 15:36 - +91 97178 23927: If you end up paying more tax in India (as your employer deducts assuming income for entire year not few months) then you can claim that amount when you’re filing your ITR for the current financial year.
Should be likewise for UK, not absolutely sure though.
9/3/22, 16:09 - +44 7767 954681: Anyone used London pass?
9/3/22, 16:11 - +44 7767 954681: Specifically for longer duration
9/3/22, 16:11 - +91 95478 29283: If i stay in india for more than 183 days but dont work for more than 183 days are the rules same?
9/3/22, 16:21 - +91 98208 88583: Yes
9/3/22, 16:58 - +44 7776 805049: Are there any Ganesh Poojas/Aarti celebrations today?
9/3/22, 17:09 - +91 88660 92416: Hello guys. I will be moving to London on 12th September and I am looking for a temporary accommodation. Please dm me if anyone has anything available for a week or 2. Thankyou :)
9/3/22, 18:10 - +91 80119 92994: likely that you'll pay less tax in UK. Because there's no tax upto 12.5k here. And for your 3 months of salary, most of it might come under this 12.5.
9/3/22, 20:18 - +91 97695 02070: Does anyone know any airbnb where they have lived earlier..or whatssap contacts of the host

9/7/22, 06:50 - +91 6387 547 833: Yes, they do work.

9/7/22, 09:39 - +91 91492 45760: Same question. Does British airways strictly follow the 32*2 policy? Or it okay if i take 3 bags, total weight 64

9/7/22, 10:27 - +91 97178 23927: right, cannot be altered once you've already purchased using standard service and booked biometric slot.
Only way is to apply fresh application with priority service

9/7/22, 22:02 - +91 97737 59478: Hey everyone!
I've moved to London recently and have been looking for apts for a while.I've paid the holding deposit for a apt and the agent mentions they'd now need full payment  (remaining deposit+1st month rent) before sending me the e-contract as their software does not have the facility to send a draft copy of the contract before final funds are paid. It sounded a bit dodgy to me, did anyone face a similar experience recently, does this sound normal?
The agency is homelink, if anyone has any prior experience with them or have any inputs here, please help me with it!
9/7/22, 22:08 - +91 6387 547 833: A380 in Emirates without any second thought
9/7/22, 22:33 - +44 7405 367004: Don't pay them.

9/7/22, 22:34 - +44 7405 367004: If they can't send you econtract, ask them if you can meet at their office and sign the contract in person and pay right there.
9/7/22, 22:36 - +44 7405 367004: Grab the keys as well there.
9/7/22, 22:37 - +44 7442 637376: Has anyone used Kuwait Airways and had a stop at Kuwait for > 8 hours? Did you get a hotel stay or something provided by the airways/airport?

9/8/22, 15:49 - +91 97178 23927: Why did you submit it? They should have just scanned and returned it to you on the spot
9/8/22, 15:55 - +91 97230 79906: I was asked for a full deposit before the contract but I told them I will only do that after signing the contract. They happily agreed. Don’t pay them the remaining amount and do prior verification before any payments. 
Apart from the points of verification mentioned in the photos above, you can check The Property Ombudsman website. Most agents are registered with them. 
You can also check on https://www.london.gov.uk/rogue-landlord-checker if they have ever been fined
9/8/22, 16:00 - +91 98454 02990: They asked for it
9/8/22, 16:06 - +91 97178 23927: If you have a receipt from them stating that they kept your degree certificate, it should be fine
9/8/22, 16:08 - +91 77740 86822: Is this for skilled worker visa? They did not ask me for such thing
9/8/22, 16:13 - +91 78774 46677: Same, they did not keep any document except passport

Some of my friends have had to wait upto 2 hours when coming from flights later in the day. So I'd recommend picking an early one.
9/11/22, 17:49 - +91 88618 97183: Was this a 7AM one?

the ticket says 4-6 hours prior to departure time, does it take that much time?
Delhi airport to be specific
9/12/22, 07:43 - +91 98200 68716: I went 3 hours early and had a comfortable 40 mins wait before boarding, Mumbai airport though. But probably depends on flight time and crowd
9/12/22, 07:45 - +91 97178 23927: thanks! apart from check in and security like domestic travel, is there also an immigration step in origin airport which could take time?
9/12/22, 07:46 - +91 86978 18442: I think it exceeds the 55 cm limit but they might be chill about the 5 cm, not super sure though.
9/12/22, 07:46 - +91 98200 68716: Yes but usually doesn’t take time. Time is basically dependent on the rush and the long queues
9/12/22, 09:23 - +91 87005 25920: What time did you land?
9/12/22, 09:24 - +91 98200 68716: 5:30 BST

9/14/22, 11:04 - +91 99168 56892: Uk not bad then. What are best stores to buy from there, apple itself or network stores ?
9/14/22, 11:05 - +44 7502 307298: m trying Amazon , apple stores are out of stock for 14 series for pick ups till next month

9/14/22, 11:19 - +44 7423 210151: Buy from UK if you can reclaim VAT on your next trip to India .. that will save you 20% and will end up cheaper than US after conversion. But surely check if you can reclaim VAT first.
9/14/22, 11:48 - +91 80119 92994: Btw, the prices mentioned in US are before tax, and prices mentioned in UK are after tax.
9/14/22, 11:50 - +44 7502 307298: aah , got it
9/14/22, 11:50 - +44 7442 637376: How do you check this?

9/20/22, 05:16 - +91 99168 56892: Like usual prescription won’t work? For instance if I am on 2 tablets Ona daily basis and for next 2yrs I want to take some aeound 1500 tablets along. Can that be questioned ?
9/20/22, 05:18 - +91 84485 10993: I am wondering the same, I am planning to take 60 tabs of one drug for the whole one year, it's not a controlled drug
9/20/22, 05:18 - +91 84485 10993: 1500 might be questioned, have you checked if it's available otc in the uk?

9/20/22, 06:14 - +44 7429 214883: why do you wanna take 1500 tablets 😂😂. 1500 of any item will get you into trouble with customs

9/20/22, 06:15 - +91 99168 56892: Why ? Well I need it. I’m not going to sell it there 😂

9/26/22, 16:30 - +91 86748 07262: Hey everyone,

I booked my schengen visa appointment for 24th Nov, but now need to visit India due to personal reasons on 4th dec. I think visa takes atleast 15 days or so. I am not able to see the booking dates for Jan right now (only dates till Dec end are visible).

I don't want to risk my india trip as my passport might be blocked with the embassy for schengen. Any tips how can I resolve the situation?
9/26/22, 16:34 - +91 97293 85331: I think Altair might be able to suggest something here
9/26/22, 16:35 - +91 86748 07262: This was for personal travel though😅
9/26/22, 16:36 - +91 97293 85331: Okay, not sure . But maybe worth a shot asking them
9/26/22, 16:39 - +91 96860 55337: Most countries give schengen visa within a week. they say 15 days for outlier cases. To be on the safe side, maybe choose the passport collection option instead of courier. This will say 1-2 days in courier transit.

Worst case, call VFS or whichever agency is handling your visa and they should be able to help you out.
9/26/22, 16:39 - +91 96860 55337: * This will save
9/26/22, 16:39 - +91 86748 07262: Thanks will try it out 😊
9/26/22, 16:59 - +91 80119 92994: Or you can reschedule it in November. You'll see dates for Jan then for sure
9/26/22, 17:05 - +91 86748 07262: Yes i am also thinking thats the safest option 😬
9/26/22, 18:20 - +91 98992 69029: Also you can ask them for priority service if applicable

9/26/22, 21:18 - +44 7747 257469: Show one more trip to the country from where you are getting the Schengen visa and put start date from 1st dec. Then they have to prioritise your visa and you will receive your passport earlier. 
Only disadvantage would be you will get visa starting from 1st dec onwards so your actual days of travel will get reduced. For ex - You are aiming from Jan - July 6 month visa but now you will have visa from Dec - June instead. 
This worked for me twice,  from France and Greece. In both case got my passport back in just 4 days 😂.
Yaha yahi hai things go quite slow sometimes agar majoor kar do toh apne aap fast kar dete hai ye log 😁
9/26/22, 21:31 - +91 86748 07262: Haha very nice idea, but having a visa in dec jan and feb would be waste. Hence will reschedule in mid nov to get a date for mid jan maybe. As we can reschedule it one time, hence that seems little better. Buy i hv to admit this is brutal 😛

9/27/22, 10:38 - +91 97574 43995: Buying luggage on website is cheaper than at airport
9/27/22, 10:39 - +91 78060 35817: Yes, does the discount apply only at the time of booking or can you add extra luggage at discount after booking the flight
9/27/22, 10:41 - +91 97574 43995: Afterwards works (that's what I did) not sure if there is some more discount if you buy with flight ticket

9/27/22, 11:49 - +91 74249 47030: You can add baggage for quite a significant discount uptil a few hours before the flight. Don't remember what's the exact period but do NOT leave it for the last moment. It will cost you almost double the price.
9/27/22, 11:59 - +91 86748 07262: Is there a discount code, that we can use or is it discounted already up untill a specific time?
9/27/22, 12:01 - +91 74249 47030: It's automatically discounted. You can also see what the discounted costs are on their websites. Also note that the discounts are different for different weight slabs. It increases for higher excess baggage weights.

9/27/22, 17:25 - +91 96168 84305: Default is 2 check in bags (23kg each)
Nd hand bag + cabin luggage

Usually enough unless you are shifting for the first time maybe
9/27/22, 17:26 - +91 98186 93845: You would be charged either per bag/extra weight (depending on the airline). The 300 usd is on top of 2check in +1 handbag

9/28/22, 10:58 - +91 98186 93845: My experience was a little different. I reached London around 8 and it was fine. The queue was there not not like a nightmare 😅
9/28/22, 10:58 - +44 7940 156531: Best time to land is mid day

9/28/22, 11:17 - +91 84485 10993: Those who travelled with BA, how strict are they with weight limits? I am 1-2 kgs over the limit
9/28/22, 11:19 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: Their official weight limit is 23kg for each checked in bag.

I had two bags of 23.7kg and 23.5kg, and they didn’t cause any problems.

9/28/22, 11:20 - +91 84485 10993: Cool, thanks!
9/28/22, 11:20 - +91 99168 56892: I doubt any airline for 1-2kg will ever cause issues
9/28/22, 11:20 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: Note that they don’t measure the cabin bag weight. If you’re slightly over the limit, move some of your stuff from check-in bags to cabin bags.
9/28/22, 11:20 - +44 7790 779277: I reached around 2, it still took 1.5 hours
9/28/22, 11:22 - +91 84485 10993: Yeah I just want to be sure😅
9/28/22, 11:23 - +91 84485 10993: Alright, thanks for the tip!

9/28/22, 14:20 - +44 7796 726402: The Govt needs to borrow money to finance its activities. Man outsiders/corporates/individuals/nations help fund this by giving loan to govt by buying bonds. But, when those people don't trust the govt and it's policies they start to ask for higher interests for these govt loans (basically how our credit score works). So, govt borrowing gets more expensive. Hence, the BoE had to step and buy some of these bonds by essentially printing more money (which causes more inflation)

9/28/22, 22:58 - +44 7584 943531: ^only if it's true lol

9/29/22, 05:34 - +91 6289 015 704: Question regarding tax on relocation: my company’s relocation provider is saying that the relocation allowance will be taxed at 47% the max. The question is that next year when we file for tax then will get any refund. I know that this amount(relocation )will be added with my payslip and then overall tax will be calculated
9/29/22, 05:50 - +91 76800 49090: Can someone throw light on taxes on relocation expenses please.
9/29/22, 05:50 - +91 76800 49090: https://www.gov.uk/expenses-and-benefits-relocation/whats-exempt#:~:text=Some%20relocation%20costs%20up%20to,moving%20costs
9/29/22, 05:51 - +91 76800 49090: I just saw this. My relocation provider is saying they can deposit the expense either in my Indian bank account or in my UK bank account ( once I move and open a bank account in UK )
9/29/22, 05:52 - +91 76800 49090: Expense = allowance *
9/29/22, 08:47 - +91 97180 83994: From what I know if your company is not paying taxes on your behalf then you'll have to pay taxes. It's just another income.

If your company is not paying taxes, then its better to ask them to send relocation amount to indian bank account in ₹, then you'll have to pay taxes in India(which is 30% max)
9/29/22, 08:54 - +91 86978 18442: I don't think the country you pay taxes in depends on the bank account you get the income in.
9/29/22, 08:56 - +91 97180 83994: It does, thats what I was told by tax advisor.
9/29/22, 08:58 - +91 97180 83994: I was about to get my relocation in Indian bank account & was told that I'll have to pay my taxes in India then.
9/29/22, 09:01 - +91 97180 83994: Also any advice here should be confirmed with your tax advisor or company 😂
9/29/22, 09:03 - +91 77740 86822: The tax should be grossed up i believe, which means you will be taxed but the tax amount will be given back to you. That's what Apple is doing. Not sure about other companies.
9/29/22, 09:05 - +91 96168 84305: If your company has to deduct tax then they ll do so in your payslip.. so that might not be your choice..
Nd if that's the case then just avoid paying tax on it twice.

9/29/22, 09:30 - +44 7429 214883: Yeah that happens with stocks as well. I got the extra taxed amount in the next paycheck
9/29/22, 09:34 - +91 74163 03635: How the stocks are taxed..somewhere i read along with individual NI,  employer NI contribution also deducts from RSU amount?
9/29/22, 09:36 - +44 7429 214883: I'm not exactly sure myself. But they tax them at the highest rate 45% and 2% something and if your tax slab is 40%, you get the 5% back.
9/29/22, 09:37 - +91 74163 03635: I read it will more than 50% because of company doesnt pay NI on RSU..that itself ~12%...I am not sure though
9/29/22, 09:38 - +44 7429 214883: Maybe, but if your salary is less than 100k then your slab will not be 45 percent. So you get some money back in next payslip.
9/29/22, 09:38 - +91 74163 03635: okk
9/29/22, 09:39 - +44 7429 214883: Also one thing to note is that if your base salary is less than 100k but total compensation is more than 100k, you'll have to pay some extra tax during self assessment
9/29/22, 09:39 - +44 7429 214883: Iirc you have to pay back £1 for every £2 you earn above 100k
9/29/22, 09:39 - +44 7429 214883: And this is not taken into consideration while they tax your stocks
9/29/22, 09:46 - +44 7429 214883: Or even if your base salary is more than 100k but less than 125k, because they don't account for paying back the personal allowance while taxing your stocks, you have to pay some money during self assessment.

10/1/22, 12:36 - +44 7796 726402: Hey all, a friend of mine who recently moved to UK got scammed on a phone where the scammers claimed an identity scam had been committed under her name. And then went on to get all her details including BRP and even got her to take a selfie with the brp. She panicked and complied with them. 

Can anyone advise about what administration actions she can take here to prevent those scammers from actually committing an identity fraud with all her details? Is there a provision to apply for a new BRP? She has already filed a police report.

10/6/22, 03:41 - +91 94390 94370: Hey can anyone tell the process of this GP registration in short please. I am a student in RCA for masters and it’s been about a month I am already in London  and haven’t  done the GP thing. 
any guidance please ..
10/6/22, 08:34 - +91 81783 47803: I booked an appointment for France schengen visa after filling an application on France visa https://france-visas.gouv.fr/en/web/france-visas/ website. I accidentally submitted an incomplete/wrong application on France visa site and used the application id to book the appointment on TFL https://fr.tlscontact.com/gb/lon/index.php

According to FAQs on France visa website, I need to fill out a new application form and take it to the same appointment (booked using wrong application id). Did anyone face this similar issue?
10/6/22, 08:41 - +44 7436 935142: You can go to your nearest GP (provided they're taking new patients) and show them some proof that you live in the area and they should do the registration for you
10/6/22, 08:42 - +44 7869 270548: It's like your go to for medical things. You have multiple options for choosing who to register with.
You can try an online gp (they also have multiple physical locations in London if you want to visit). Sign up process was very quick, https://www.gpathand.nhs.uk/
10/6/22, 09:27 - +44 7385 947429: I think it should be fine, i have heard people doing it
10/6/22, 09:46 - +91 78694 33558: Hi Everyone!
Looking for a place for a short period- from the 11th / 12th of October till the month end (30th, Sunday) - preferably a room for a couple! Do let me know if anyone has any leads 🙏🏻🍻
10/6/22, 10:04 - +91 95607 72474: Hey, Friend of mine is traveling to India, so does he need to do any covid related formalities?
10/6/22, 10:06 - +44 7423 718314: I think air suvidha form online has to be filled up.
10/6/22, 10:13 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Yep! But ofcourse no one checks
10/6/22, 10:14 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Someone asked me if i had filled it and that’s it🤷‍♂️
10/6/22, 10:20 - +44 7423 718314: Gulf air check in guys me asked for passport, air suvidha form and latest covid vaccine doc. That is it
10/6/22, 10:21 - +91 95607 72474: Ok, no harm in filling. Also, i believe they won’t ask for hard copies.
10/6/22, 10:30 - +44 7903 678132: Anyone applied for norways schengen visa recently? Just wanted to get an idea about the waiting times
10/6/22, 11:17 - +44 7423 718314: Yeah no hard copies
10/6/22, 12:10 - +91 78060 35817: What’s the easiest way to get a credit card in London? And how long does it take to get one?
10/6/22, 12:11 - +91 78060 35817: Is it possible to get one without a permanent address
10/6/22, 12:36 - +91 97110 90746: applied for amex, got within a week.
10/6/22, 12:37 - +91 86748 07262: Generally it takes around 3 months to get ur credit history, then u can get any cc u want. In thr mean time u can try applying and the bank can provide it to u if they feel ur salary is good wrt. ur expenses and u will nit be a defaulter
10/6/22, 12:54 - +91 78060 35817: For this I’ll need to get my first salary? Is it not possible to get it in the first month itself?
10/6/22, 13:04 - +91 77740 86822: India me toh prasad jaise baant te hain 🤣
10/6/22, 13:16 - +91 99204 31965: I guess you atleast need a bank statement as an address proof of UK
10/6/22, 13:58 - +91 86748 07262: Its actually tough to get a cc here. If u work in a very good and reputated company then bank may give it. But they will enquire about ur salary and ur offer letter
10/6/22, 14:46 - +91 98998 63352: Is anyone looking for a flatmate from December, please dm me

10/7/22, 11:28 - +91 99168 56892: Just like Paytm where we link credit to pay online, is there a similar app to link a uk card and pay someone online via credit card?
10/7/22, 11:30 - +91 97110 90746: Try PayPal?
10/7/22, 11:32 - +91 99168 56892: Is it money transfer or one can use it to pay via credit card?
10/7/22, 13:32 - +44 7767 954681: Has anyone received a call claiming they are from HMRC and stating you have done fraud in taxes? 
Talking about hiring a criminal solicitor to fight the case or pay the taxes during call. It was 99% a scam call it seems
10/7/22, 13:33 - +91 98869 86684: I head from most people it was scam
10/7/22, 13:34 - +44 7423 210151: Yes … and also if you press 1 or keep on the phone then a charge may show up on your phone bill. Just disconnect any time you receive this scam call.
10/7/22, 13:34 - +91 94286 61452: maybe we can ask to send a written notice 😅
10/7/22, 13:34 - +91 94286 61452: instead of calling
10/7/22, 13:35 - +91 94286 61452: if it's legit
10/7/22, 13:35 - +44 7423 210151: With the economy is going in toilet here .. there are going to be more n more such scam calls
10/7/22, 13:35 - +44 7767 954681: Yeah, just wanted to highlight to other folks
10/7/22, 13:35 - +44 7423 210151: HMRC will usually not call you out of the blue .. they send letters first and only if they are not able to get hold of you is when they try calling
10/7/22, 13:37 - +44 7767 954681: But the guy mentioned they had sent letters twice or something but it had bounced back

10/7/22, 13:39 - +44 7423 210151: Well of course .. if its a smart scammer he will know how hmrc works as well
10/7/22, 13:42 - +91 74249 47030: It would be so awesome if you just told off an actual HMRC employee and they get pissed off 😂
10/7/22, 13:42 - +44 7767 954681: When I asked to confirm about the legitimacy, he even called from a number which was same  as mentioned in Ministry of justice.
10/7/22, 14:03 - +44 7547 160050: hmrc or gov never calls in this country 
period
10/7/22, 14:04 - +44 7547 160050: they always send post 😂
10/7/22, 14:12 - +44 7423 210151: And then what did they tell you ?

10/7/22, 17:24 - +91 99168 56892: This is about finding some professional cleaners in zone 2 if anybody knows ?
10/7/22, 17:30 - +91 97180 83994: Doesn't it count as FX trading if I convert to usd then back to gbp?
10/7/22, 17:30 - +91 97180 83994: Capital gains tax should apply in that case
10/7/22, 17:38 - +44 7547 160050: part time traders are exempt but depends on a lot of factors
10/7/22, 17:39 - +44 7385 957410: Ideally it should be!

10/7/22, 17:47 - +91 74163 03635: Can we open revolut account from India? Does we get Debit card for intial 1 month usage? Or  Forex card is better ?
10/7/22, 17:49 - +44 7940 156531: It works for some people from India and for some it doesn't. Wise is easier to open from India. With both of them you get a debit card which you can add to apple pay or Google pay to use everywhere. Forex card I also got when I moved but I barely used it. Using wise was much better
10/7/22, 18:10 - +91 97178 23927: Get Niyo for first few day expenses and get Revolut after reaching.
10/7/22, 18:14 - +91 74163 03635: Is niyo better than forex card?

10/7/22, 18:46 - +91 97178 23927: I felt so yes
Most of the forex cards which don’t have surcharges are prepaid, you’d need to load money in GBP beforehand 
Niyo you can load money in INR with no surcharges
10/7/22, 18:47 - +91 97180 83994: No you cant
10/7/22, 19:21 - +91 91980 35202: Does anyone have Rajasthani tiffin service contact?

10/11/22, 19:56 - +91 82803 09437: Guys, we are leaving this place in the coming month -2nd  November and just as a good will  gesture to the owner we thought of posting  it here. Have a look at the pdf and let us know.
10/11/22, 20:31 - +44 7469 448374: GP will make a lot of fuss to prescribe.. u can check if ur employer offers some service like Babylon
10/11/22, 20:43 - +91 96545 88845: Well, I was able to arrange online (without prescription). Here, they charge 100-150 pounds to write the prescription. And, you know how private clinics are; they are like 250 for one sitting. Lol, I wish we rule them someday.😂
10/11/22, 20:53 - +44 7423 210151: Speed post from India lets you get medicines
10/11/22, 20:53 - +44 7423 210151: Good old bhartiya daak khana
10/11/22, 20:53 - +91 96545 88845: Thanks for the information mate!
10/11/22, 20:54 - +44 7824 063660: Do they let medicines pass through customs? Because I have heard they take out the medicines from parcel
10/11/22, 20:55 - +44 7423 210151: I guess depends on time and luck .. My parents sent and I got it
10/11/22, 20:56 - +91 96545 88845: Well, the answer is yes. Even I have got a bundle and no one even bothered to verify.
10/11/22, 20:56 - +44 7423 210151: Otherwise just coordinate with someone in this group to carry it from India and then within UK you can it picked and delivered to you by Hermes
10/11/22, 20:58 - +1 (226) 792-6466: people even get weed and M delivered through customs 🤷‍♂️
10/11/22, 20:58 - +91 96545 88845: One suggestion to all, please never use their antiseptic cream. I got a burn using UK based antiseptic cream. 
Better use borilin or boroplus, and may be any India based.
10/11/22, 20:58 - +44 7423 210151: Once someone told me about this group or site also where people were selling extra space in their luggage on certain popular international routes .. log kafi entrepreneurial hai aaj kal

10/11/22, 21:18 - +44 7423 210151: Yes dont think liquid form is possible to be sent
10/11/22, 21:33 - +44 7570 790864: If you have some form of evidence (like a prescription  from india), you should be able to get a regular prescription from an NHS GP here. Once you register and have your medication added to their system, you can request it online as well through their electronic prescription request form. We also do 3 monthly repeat prescriptions so you don't need to keep requesting. If you're in the UK long term, this might be less hassle overall
10/11/22, 21:35 - +44 7570 790864: Writing the prescription is a free service. You'd only have to pay for the medicines, which is a flat rate at like £9

10/13/22, 18:21 - +44 7429 214883: Oh wow. Nice. Didn't think of this xD
10/13/22, 18:51 - +91 95016 22311: There is condition in there. That's possible only when you are traveling from set of countries via Singapore.

I had taken that once takes 5 minutes at the immigration desk
10/13/22, 18:52 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Nope, I’ve done that with random ass countries no issues
10/13/22, 18:52 - +1 (226) 792-6466: You need a visa from a specific set of countries yes, but a uk one satisfies that anyway
10/13/22, 18:55 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Takes a bit longer if you come from some countries as they need to chdck your yellow fever vaxx again and again and again
10/13/22, 18:58 - +91 95016 22311: You are actually right it was about having visa for certain countries
10/13/22, 18:58 - +44 7429 214883: You need to have visas for some specific countries
10/13/22, 18:58 - +44 7429 214883: Luckily UK is one of them :)

10/13/22, 18:59 - +1 (226) 792-6466: yeah
10/13/22, 18:59 - +1 (226) 792-6466: sometimes i only had a layover for 2-3 days instead
10/13/22, 18:59 - +1 (226) 792-6466: but as long as your flight leaves in <96 you gucci
10/13/22, 19:00 - +1 (226) 792-6466: i've done this 20+ times, no issues
10/13/22, 19:00 - +91 95016 22311: But it has to be a transit I believe. You need to have a ticket to a third county

10/14/22, 15:11 - +91 84590 80129: Please let me know if you come across one
10/14/22, 15:15 - +91 97178 23927: depends how soon you can get your salary/relocation cash in your account tbh
if you're expecting within a week, 10-15k in your niyo are good enough (provided you just spend on travel/groceries/eating)

10/14/22, 16:08 - +44 7747 257469: Eurostar business premier
10/14/22, 16:08 - +91 99357 01111: Has anyone tried Eurostar premier and got refunded?
10/14/22, 16:08 - +1 (226) 792-6466: euro star is 100% refundable if you book the more expensive tix
10/14/22, 16:08 - +1 (226) 792-6466: yeah
10/14/22, 16:08 - +1 (226) 792-6466: air france/klm charges some fee regardless iirc
10/14/22, 16:09 - +91 99357 01111: Did u get cash or eurostar credit as refund?
10/14/22, 16:09 - +1 (226) 792-6466: cash

10/14/22, 16:10 - +44 7429 214883: But for the business class ones you'll get the refund
10/14/22, 16:10 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Yeah just book the ones on the right most column

10/14/22, 16:17 - +1 (510) 370-2010: Hi Everyone,
I am subletting my room for a short term from 14th Nov- 23rd Dec in E14 6GX. It's a 3 bedroom apartment fully furnished. Just opposite to the Langdon park tube station(very close to the central). This apartment is on the 5th floor which has a balcony with a beautiful view. It has a big hall and a fully furnished kitchen.
The room will have a double size bed and a wardrobe. Washroom will be shared with a female. Please DM if anyone is interested.
10/15/22, 04:47 - +91 87007 83753: Can anyone tell me the type of shoes I should buy from India? I've heard decathlon is good but I wanted to know which type exactly.
10/15/22, 08:08 - +44 7423 793979: Anyone at Heathrow airport now?
10/15/22, 09:19 - +91 87268 14391: Anyone uses revolut while traveling in Europe?
10/15/22, 09:19 - +91 87268 14391: What are the charges like?
10/15/22, 09:31 - +44 7747 257469: Yes, I used in Greece and as far as I remember when you transfer directly into someone’s account there is no extra fees for it. But if you are withdrawing from Atm machine then there is some free limit, above that limit if you withdraw you have to pay around 2% extra charge on the total amount you have withdrawn.
10/15/22, 09:34 - +91 87268 14391: Okay, so normal card payments wouldn't have any fees. That's cool
10/15/22, 10:20 - +91 88618 97183: Buy walking shoes which are preferably water proof. You'll be walking a lot if you're in zone 1/2 working / studying
10/15/22, 10:48 - +91 99168 56892: Is hotspot function disabled in the UK? I’m using Lyca sim.
10/15/22, 10:48 - +91 99168 56892: I can’t create a hotspot for others to use in iPhone XR
10/15/22, 10:49 - +44 7425 908007: <Media omitted>
10/15/22, 10:58 - +44 7776 651349: Basically whenever you plan to leave the month after that will be paid
So you need to leave a month before you actually want to
As far as i know, thats how my gym works too
10/15/22, 10:59 - +91 90878 58510: Any suggestions for good GP in Stratford?
10/15/22, 11:01 - +44 7867 099227: You’ve to add additional config in your settings - google it
10/15/22, 12:14 - +44 7469 448374: Try to buy comfortable walking shoes which are water proof
10/15/22, 12:15 - +44 7469 448374: And warm also..next few months will be cold and wet
10/15/22, 14:21 - +91 84590 80129: Woodland are good enough?
10/15/22, 14:50 - +91 94390 94370: Hey, is there any specific link to register with a GP ? Can anyone please share if they have it.
10/15/22, 14:51 - +91 94390 94370: And how do we choose ? Like what should I see. Or just go with anyone random? Or is that randomly allotted?
10/15/22, 15:00 - +44 7869 270548: You have multiple options for choosing who to register with.
You can try an online gp (they also have multiple physical locations in London if you want to visit). Sign up process was very quick when I registered for https://www.gpathand.nhs.uk/
10/15/22, 15:02 - +91 99117 86650: Hi

Please dm if interested
10/15/22, 15:16 - +91 94390 94370: Okay thanks a lot. Will check out.
10/15/22, 17:16 - +91 93545 56594: Anyone who has travelled with Swiss Airlines before with a layover in Zurich? Is there a need for transit Visa?
10/15/22, 17:17 - +91 93545 56594: PS: Is anyone travelling back to India on 18th Oct
10/15/22, 17:22 - +91 74163 03635: Hi All,  Can any provide reviews about Gulf Airways (via Bahrain) && Ethihad airways(via Abu Dhabi). We are traveling for the first time with kid, so Luggage and convenience are the priority. Is any transit Visa required in Bahrain & Abhudhabi?
10/15/22, 17:30 - +44 7825 722378: I had a layover of 2:30 hrs in Abu Dhabi and no transit visa was required
10/15/22, 17:31 - +91 70913 81321: No, transit visa is not required, provided that you do not leave the airport
10/15/22, 17:32 - +91 93545 56594: Thanks Prit 👍🏻
10/15/22, 18:04 - +91 74163 03635: Ok thanks..any info about the airlines mentioned?
10/15/22, 18:07 - +44 7825 722378: Etihad
10/15/22, 18:16 - +91 74163 03635: How was it..and its luggage policy?
10/15/22, 18:17 - +91 78060 35817: What do you guys recommend one get for food when moving to London for the first time? I have 70Kg luggage allowance but don’t know what to pack😐
10/15/22, 18:25 - +91 99294 55503: All the grocery
10/15/22, 18:33 - +91 94390 94370: Tbh I feel you can get everything here. Any specific food you can’t live without then grab it. Or else you ll get all indian food and groceries  here. Don’t over burden the luggage with lots of heavy food I would say. 

To each their own though.
10/15/22, 18:34 - +44 7747 257469: In case you leave the airport, won’t uk brp would be good enough to stay there for couple of days? Any idea?
10/15/22, 18:36 - +44 7429 214883: You've got a Schengen visa. Use that 😂
10/15/22, 18:37 - +44 7940 156531: Just some particular masale and any specific Indian utensils you need for cooking. Otherwise you'll find everything here
10/15/22, 18:38 - +91 99672 88639: Utensils are costly here 😢
10/15/22, 18:38 - +44 7940 156531: Everything is but I still don't see the point burdening your luggage from India unless you have someone to help you carry it here
10/15/22, 18:39 - +44 7940 156531: Atleast we still manage to find Indian stuff. In many other countries it's hard to even get it for a price
10/15/22, 18:39 - +91 78060 35817: I don’t have to carry it and my company is going to pay for everything, so it doesn’t make sense to pay multifold for the same stuff in london
10/15/22, 18:39 - +91 99672 88639: Ya, if it is possible to carry, better to bring
10/15/22, 18:40 - +44 7940 156531: If you're shipping it then sure, send all the utensils
10/15/22, 18:40 - +44 7867 099227: A lot of ready to cook stuff - helps in your initial days - Gits is really good
10/15/22, 18:46 - +91 70913 81321: Not sure but I don't think uk residence status helps anywhere in europe
10/15/22, 18:52 - +91 94549 32137: Do we get ready to cook indian meals easily there?
10/15/22, 18:56 - +91 97178 23927: Mostly frozen stuff 
Bring haldiram or MTR ready to cook packets that’d be better
10/15/22, 19:05 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Only if you swim across the channel
10/15/22, 19:25 - +44 7747 257469: Hold on, I was talking about Abu Dhabi FYI. 
Let’s consider the best case: World’s best swimmer decide to do the same also, he will have to cross Europe + entire Africa. Which will be atleast 10000km, assuming avg speed 2km/hr and if he will be swimming 15hr daily then it will take him 1 year approx to reach there in the best case 😂. And probably will die in between so this option doesn’t make sense I guess but if you want to try please go ahead and let me know about the experience😉
10/15/22, 19:26 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Bro the english channel is like 33km
10/15/22, 19:29 - +44 7747 257469: It only connects France as far as I know to UK, not the entire world bro
10/15/22, 19:31 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Which is how you can go to zurich with a uk Brp right
10/15/22, 19:31 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Anyway this discussion is entirely pointless 😂
10/15/22, 19:33 - +91 97180 83994: This message was deleted
10/15/22, 21:30 - +44 7825 458701: Hey, I am looking for a flatmate and it's a 2 BHK flat fully furnished with separate bathrooms in Greenwich (SE10 9GQ). If you are interested please dm! It's available from 1st of Nov.

10/16/22, 01:19 - +44 7869 270548: Ghee is also available in some tescos :)
10/16/22, 04:47 - +91 87007 83753: Is this travel adaptor adequate?
https://dl.flipkart.com/s/i7HyLANNNN
10/16/22, 08:01 - +91 77608 12589: Yes it is
10/16/22, 08:02 - +91 96168 84305: Yes it saved me quite a few times. The build is not great though..
I would suggest an extension (UK+IN one) as well. You will have to buy a simple converter for it
10/16/22, 08:12 - +91 98208 88583: U will get amul ghee in aldi, lidl or few off license stores as well
10/16/22, 11:29 - +91 94552 22973: Hi guys, what recharge is required to continue to keep the jio number active and receive messages ?

This is enough if you already have International Roaming activated. For IR, I think you can activate that from MyJio app or by recharging with with an IR pack while still in India

10/16/22, 15:37 - +91 74163 03635: How to stream in smart tv?
10/16/22, 15:39 - +91 94552 22973: Thanks
10/16/22, 15:54 - +91 70302 21187: Do we need GP prescription etc to buy multivitamins here?
If not, then where can we buy them?
10/16/22, 16:02 - +44 7443 077947: superdrug/boots
10/16/22, 16:32 - +44 7869 270548: Antibiotics are prescription drugs, but multivitamins, paracetamol, pain killers etc you can just buy over the counter.

Vitl is also really nice (it is a company that gives personalised multivitamins)
10/16/22, 17:08 - +44 7747 257469: Does anyone got US tourist visa accepted from here?
10/16/22, 17:11 - Anirudh Mittal: Hey

Did anyone here apply for Schengen Visa recently and know if slots are available for France/Germany/Netherlands?
10/16/22, 17:13 - +91 86978 18442: Yes

Also, cost[London->UAE->India] is almost half compared to cost[London->India]. This is an another motivation to spend money at the right place rather than giving it to the airlines 🫠
10/16/22, 20:16 - +44 7767 185174: Adding to this, you don't need to apply for UAE visa if you have UK visa or even US visa. You can get a 14 day visa on arrival at some nominal price.
10/16/22, 20:17 - +91 98867 65648: UK visa means BRP you mean or even UK tourist visa works ?
10/16/22, 20:17 - +44 7767 185174: BRP.
10/16/22, 20:18 - +44 7747 257469: And if you have Schengen visa then you even don’t have to pay 30£ fee
10/16/22, 20:18 - +44 7767 185174: For US i think it is also the visa and not only green card
10/16/22, 20:18 - +44 7767 185174: Oh nice.
10/16/22, 20:19 - +44 7747 257469: That’s right

10/18/22, 13:58 - +91 99875 77153: I think that insurance would payout if Eurostar cancels the train and you need to find alternative travel

10/18/22, 14:41 - +91 99357 01111: While applying schengen, if we show the first date of travel 2 months after the appointment, do we get entry permit earlier than that?
10/18/22, 14:42 - +44 7940 156531: No the entry permit is generally given from the day you showed your first entry or the day before that
10/18/22, 15:14 - +91 99875 77153: Depends on the country. For France, my 6 month visa started from the day i got my passport.

10/19/22, 05:03 - +91 87007 83753: That was my doubt. My license is in English. Would I still require an IDP?
10/19/22, 05:03 - +91 95012 72430: Yup, I read it somewhere that even if we have the Indian license, we still need an IDP to be able to drive in the UK
10/19/22, 05:04 - +91 95012 72430: It’s a permit that we can drive internationally using our Indian license
10/19/22, 05:37 - +91 88262 98088: I don’t think so. One of my friends said we didn’t need it 🤷🏻‍♂️
10/19/22, 07:32 - +44 7824 063660: IDP was older requirement, now it only requires to have English language in licence, i even drove in states , but i know requirement of IDP like 8 years back

10/19/22, 08:47 - +91 96647 01912: Hi, I have Schengen visa appointment for France today and the hotel booking that I did to show has been cancelled by booking.com itself. Does anyone know what to do in such circumstances? I've already put the details of the hotel in the visa form documents so can't change that now.
10/19/22, 08:52 - +44 7459 511980: You can change it, it doesn't matter. They'll simply scratch it on the form
10/19/22, 08:54 - +44 7879 996571: Do they check the hotel confirmation during the appointment?
10/19/22, 08:56 - +44 7405 367004: I guess no.
10/19/22, 08:56 - +44 7405 367004: Even if it is cancelled, how would they know.
10/19/22, 08:57 - +44 7405 367004: My friend cancelled his flights abd hôtel bookings soon after the appointment as he had 24 hours time frame.
10/19/22, 08:59 - +91 96168 84305: Technically they can call the hotel Nd confirm ..
Atleast for flights they have their system to confirm the booking..

But personally I dont think they check every time.
In this case, I would suggest just create new cancellable booking Nd show that (if possible)
10/19/22, 09:25 - +44 7547 160050: I used it without IDP in Scotland and europe

10/19/22, 09:39 - +91 96168 84305: That's the answer we were looking for 😛

10/19/22, 10:29 - +91 88618 97183: Just want to see how reliable the company is. Tfl website redirects me to another website hence I am skeptical
10/19/22, 10:30 - +91 88618 97183: Question 2: Does digital railcard impair you because it seems physical rail cards will take some time to come
10/19/22, 10:32 - +44 7869 270548: Yes
10/19/22, 10:33 - +44 7869 270548: Yes
10/19/22, 10:33 - +91 97178 23927: Yes

Gist: Trainline might be a better idea than Railcard app directly. You would also get 1/3rd off on the railcard cost itself if you use the coupon code in the link above 😄
10/19/22, 11:10 - +91 88618 97183: Yep got the discount

10/19/22, 11:31 - +44 7869 270548: There are lots of Indian stores there. If you walk around you should be able to find all the things you need. Is there any particular grocery you are looking for?

10/19/22, 11:32 - +44 7442 644586: An official working on any underground station can do that for you
10/19/22, 11:36 - +44 7869 270548: in Zones 1-2. Also make sure to link your oyster card with an oyster account
10/19/22, 11:40 - +91 94286 61452: yes
10/19/22, 11:40 - +91 94286 61452: yes
10/19/22, 11:47 - +91 97939 85367: Go to any tube station - avoid crowded stations like kings cross or Liverpool street etc. 

There would be an assistance booth in mostly every underground station. They will take your railcard number and then link it with your Oyster card. (You have to carry your Oyster card with you)

I am not sure everyone knows or not but railcard linked Oyster card gives you 30% off on off-peak trips in all the tube and overground lines. 

On peak hours = rush hours = Weekdays 06:30 - 09:30 and 16:00 - 19:00
10/19/22, 11:48 - +91 94286 61452: + discount on National rail at all times irrespective of peak hours

I know these instructions aren’t for Trainline specifically but it should be the same.

Also there’s 1/3rd off on Trainline railcard if you use coupon code NEWTERM33
10/19/22, 14:14 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Did you include the < symbols
10/19/22, 14:14 - +91 78694 33558: Yes
10/19/22, 14:18 - +91 86690 91448: I had done this. I don't exactly remember, but I compared it with the example they provide
10/19/22, 14:19 - +91 86690 91448: Each passport number is in a specific format. The number you enter should just match that format, and it should accept it
10/19/22, 14:19 - +91 78694 33558: Yeah still unable to figure
10/19/22, 14:19 - +91 78694 33558: Yes, you're right!
10/19/22, 14:19 - +91 86690 91448: Eg, country code IN - DOB in a place, gender, etc
10/19/22, 14:19 - +91 78694 33558: Yep Yep
10/19/22, 14:19 - +91 86690 91448: You can look up the international format and do that
10/19/22, 14:20 - +91 86690 91448: Instead of spaces it uses the < symbol, as mentioned above
10/19/22, 14:20 - +91 86690 91448: Like a separator for the fields
10/19/22, 14:21 - +91 78694 33558: Ok

10/19/22, 16:43 - +44 7869 270548: I don't think so.

Generally UK plans are much more costly than Indian plans, so I would recommend that you keep doing the minimum recharge on your Jio number and keep it active (probably you have many important things like aadhar) linked with your phone number... so you might want to make sure not to loose it.
10/19/22, 16:44 - +91 99168 56892: Lyca has worse network
10/19/22, 16:45 - +44 7869 270548: Lebara is usually good. Giffgaff should be fine too. You can check out https://kayvault.notion.site/Zero-to-One-in-London-befec90fea994d8fae423a13d76048ad#45544714ee3d49e98617c2b344b840a0 (there are also some referral codes there which will give you discounts when/if you switch to a different provider)
10/19/22, 16:49 - +1 (226) 792-6466: nope
10/19/22, 16:59 - +91 94390 94370: Thanks for asking! I was also curious about the same.
10/19/22, 17:00 - +91 94390 94370: Ahh right. 
So I just directly came to UK and didn’t have time to do any international recharge. 


Can I do it here now? 
It’s been about 50 days of inactivity of my JIO sim on a dead phone.
10/19/22, 17:01 - +91 94390 94370: Absolutely worst; 
Got this 5g iPhone and I get a 3G most of the times!! So frustrating to see this in LONDON.
10/19/22, 17:01 - +91 94390 94370: I expected a 10G speed here all over!
10/19/22, 17:02 - +44 7869 270548: You don’t need an international plan generally. For me, normal Airtel recharges to keep number alive are enough to keep it active. They do require to use it once in six months or something. You can send a random SMS for that
10/19/22, 17:03 - +44 7869 270548: <Media omitted>
10/19/22, 17:03 - +91 94390 94370: ✅ okay! Thanks 
Will port the sim asap 

Or use a new one
10/19/22, 17:03 - +91 94390 94370: Where do you stay? 👀
10/19/22, 17:04 - +44 7869 270548: This was at a dlr station. I think westferry
10/19/22, 17:06 - +91 94286 61452: India much better in terms of network connectivity than UK 🫡
10/19/22, 17:06 - +91 94390 94370: Okay got it. 
Can I do all of these here in UK? 
Coz I didn’t process anything in india.
10/19/22, 17:07 - +44 7869 270548: Yes
10/19/22, 17:07 - +91 94390 94370: Absolutely!  Even my village area has network! Here in white city room I don’t have full tower 😌🤷
10/19/22, 17:15 - +91 94390 94370: How do you people manage your calendars and schedules? 
I am missing out imp meetings/ classes / exhibitions/ events etc. 

Is there any preferred app that you feel keeps you on track with good sonic reminders?
10/19/22, 17:21 - +91 97178 23927: Looking for advice on how people send money to India. I know Wise and Remitly are options but from what I understand they charge fee everytime you transfer money. So what could be good/cheap recurring transfer options?
Also people send money in their own NRE accounts or their parents'/relatives' etc? Trying to understand tax implications and which option is better.
10/19/22, 17:31 - +44 7869 270548: Remitly/Wise should be the best option. Yes there are charges but it isn’t too bad. Send in chunks if possible. Fees generally becomes linear after certain amount. I feel that magic number is roughly £1k. 

Transferring to your own NRE account would be the best in terms of tax. You’re just moving your own money.
10/19/22, 17:40 - +44 7824 063660: Remitly gives free transfer first time , but i have compared others and even after fee , wise gives the best rate
10/19/22, 17:41 - +91 99719 94016: But isn't it like if you're already paying taxes here you don't have to pay in India, so you just transfer directly to NRO account (if you want to spend it, not park)? 🤔
10/19/22, 17:45 - +91 99719 94016: <Media omitted>
10/19/22, 17:45 - +91 99719 94016: https://www.extravelmoney.com/blog/tax-on-sending-money-to-india-from-abroad/
10/19/22, 17:46 - +91 97178 23927: Yes, I think what I meant was if we can directly transfer to parents account as money parked in NRO is non taxable (double) but was not sure of parent's account
10/19/22, 17:52 - +44 7869 270548: You can’t directly transfer to NRO internationally. You can do it NRE and then move to NRO
10/19/22, 17:54 - +91 97178 23927: Right. Also any interest on NRO is taxed at highest rate.
10/19/22, 17:54 - +91 99719 94016: You mean legally you shouldn't?
10/19/22, 17:54 - +44 7869 270548: In India you can transfer money to your immediate relatives (parents, children, partner) with no tax implications. I don’t know if NRI status complicates that or if UK tax would be interested in you moving money outside of your NRI account in India. 

In general I think tax is more complicated for people who receive it than those who send it. So to your parents should be fine IMO

But I am not a lawyer or know the laws too well, so double check or consult someone
10/19/22, 17:54 - +91 97178 23927: NRE is tax exempt but I think you cannot spend it from there?
10/19/22, 17:55 - +91 97178 23927: What do you do in general? Was looking for what people have been doing till now
10/19/22, 17:55 - +44 7869 270548: I think it just wouldn’t happen technically. When you are sending money, one of the options is to send to your NRE account. Doesn’t say NRO. 

And there’s no need for it anyway. Transferring to NRE and then moving to NRO shouldn’t give you any disadvantage at all
10/19/22, 17:56 - +44 7869 270548: You can spend
10/19/22, 17:56 - +91 99719 94016: Hmm, I transferred a few days back, UK account se directly NRO
10/19/22, 17:56 - +44 7869 270548: I make all transfers to my NRE. Keep most of my bank money in it. Transfer from there to wherever is needed. 

Zerodha NRI wouldn’t allow NRE payments so I move to NRO and then to Zerodha
10/19/22, 17:57 - +44 7869 270548: Oooh okay
10/19/22, 18:00 - +91 97178 23927: Got it, thanks.

10/23/22, 17:50 - +44 7425 908007: Quick question regd France visa application -
_Were your fingerprints collected within in the past 59 months for the purpose of applying for a Schengen Visa?_

If I had biometrics done in India for a previous visa, does that count?
10/23/22, 17:51 - +44 7425 908007: previous schengen visa for a different schengen country^
10/23/22, 17:52 - +44 7713 957402: Yes it counts for any country
Regardless, they will ask you at the centre if you want to take biometrics again or just reuse the old ones
10/23/22, 18:11 - +44 7747 257469: Did you able to reuse the old ones?I’ve applied for 4 times and every time they always asked me to go through the biometrics again.
10/23/22, 18:12 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Yeah netherlands/norway and germany lets you
10/23/22, 18:23 - +91 99357 01111: Yeah, i also had to go through biometrics again (after 6 months of prev appointment)
10/23/22, 18:23 - +91 99357 01111: France
10/23/22, 18:26 - +44 7713 957402: Yes I was able to reuse
10/23/22, 18:27 - +44 7747 257469: Which country?
10/23/22, 18:33 - +44 7713 957402: Previous visa was from Spain
New one is from France
(I haven't got my visa yet so we'll know in some time XD)
10/23/22, 18:42 - +44 7502 307298: I asked them to use the older ones, they wanted exact date of biometrics that I didn’t have …
Shared with them previous schengen copy also but of no use
so has to redo it
10/23/22, 18:50 - +44 7747 257469: That’s surprising that France let you reuse the old biometric, maybe you got the lucky counter number(probably the Indian guy one). Others who are validating the applications mostly I found them dismissive & non- cooperating and always try their best to find out any flaw in your application.
10/23/22, 20:00 - +91 85578 66475: Hi All, I have recently re located to Manchester from India, while searching for accomodation , they are asking for guarantor who owns home in UK

10/23/22, 20:01 - +44 7423 718314: I was able to reuse biometric for France visa as well.

In fact I had last given my biometric to France in 2019 while applying from india. Even then I was able to reuse it recently
10/23/22, 20:02 - +1 (226) 792-6466: If you’re going to the center with an appointment anyway then does it matter? It’s only useful imo if you can just sen/drop off your documents without an appointment

Just goes on to show how things while they might not be the best at all times but why UK is a fairer country to live in terms of racial equality.
10/24/22, 14:37 - +44 7385 957410: That's just the number game, the UK has far more % of immigrants than America.
10/24/22, 14:41 - +91 88618 97183: Interesting. Are we specifically referring to people of colour or all immigrants?

They can transfer to my indian acc and then I do the transactions to my hostel, Lloyd bank etc. Or they themselves do these transactions to my accommodation and my Lloyd bank. Which would be a good option?

10/28/22, 16:17 - +44 7940 156531: Depends on where you're travelling. Think I used regiojet in Austria and that was fully refundable. Could try buses too. Or just put down a car booking and say you intend to drive

Also the queue at the immigration sometimes takes 3-4 hours so you can plan accordingly.

11/4/22, 11:24 - +91 99168 56892: I had got my TB test done as a dependent earlier on but later due to change in situation, I applied as a primary applicant my TB report had visa category as dependent and yet it was submitted and visa granted. Spelling is way too small thing to cause issues.
11/4/22, 11:25 - +91 99168 56892: But if you have doubts, they Center can re issue it with correction . Don’t think they charge anything but it won’t be an issue as far as I know.
Good luck !

11/4/22, 11:49 - +44 7385 957410: Is NI a part of income tax, while considering to pay tax in foreign country?
11/4/22, 11:57 - +91 84590 80129: NI ?
11/4/22, 11:58 - +44 7423 210151: Dont worry about such things ..
11/4/22, 12:00 - +44 7423 210151: With the correct NI number your employer should apply the correct tax code to deduct NI contributions .. even if that doesn’t happen, the excess you pay should get refunded to you later. They cannot charge you additional NI.

11/8/22, 21:43 - +91 98115 73710: I did not book the tickets in advance.
11/8/22, 21:43 - +91 98115 73710: I applied approx 8 months back
11/8/22, 21:44 - +91 99294 55503: And you have received it ?
11/8/22, 21:45 - +91 98115 73710: Haha yes.
11/8/22, 21:45 - +44 7833 878494: For UK tickets not required. I applied 2 months back and revived it with in a week
11/8/22, 21:46 - +44 7833 878494: Lead time depends on their work load
11/8/22, 21:46 - +91 99294 55503: I read somewhere that if we are applying for the first time then we should apply for 6 months. Is that correct?  6 months seems less to me
11/8/22, 21:46 - +44 7833 878494: I applied for 6 months but I don’t think it’s mandatory
11/8/22, 21:58 - +44 7429 214883: and what was your visa start date?
11/9/22, 08:23 - +91 90132 83051: Hi Everyone!! I'm Sumit from Delhi. I would be working as Technology Consultant (Insurance) in one of the Big 4 Organisation.

I would be new to London and would be looking forward to connect with folks to buddy up on my flat search. Ideally I am looking for a places with good connectivity with central london where my absolute top end budget is 1000 pounds (including bills) but would naturally want to keep it less than that.

Let me know if you have a room (preferably 2 bed 2 bath) or want to buddy up to look for a place. Open to sublet options too for initial days/months (Travel date - 30th december 2023)
11/9/22, 08:37 - +91 77740 86822: December 2023? Quite of a future plan you are making.
11/9/22, 08:38 - +91 90132 83051: Typo - december 2022
11/9/22, 08:39 - +91 99168 56892: £1000 with bills in central London in a 2Bed2Bath will be a cracking deal!
Good luck!
11/9/22, 08:41 - +91 90132 83051: A room in 2 bed 2 bath flat with good connectivity to central london bro
11/9/22, 08:42 - +91 90132 83051: Guess you didn't read that right
11/9/22, 08:42 - +91 99168 56892: I read it right but current scenario is horrible.
11/9/22, 08:42 - +91 90132 83051: Yep agree
11/9/22, 08:42 - +91 99168 56892: In London for expats specially for housing
11/9/22, 08:44 - +91 90132 83051: Yep would be looking in zone 2 or 3, Let's see
11/9/22, 08:44 - +91 90132 83051: 😊
11/9/22, 08:46 - +91 99168 56892: Try Rightmove/Zoopla as well in advance to get an idea what kind of availability is there. £1000 including means £1500-£1600 rent for 2bhk and that’s quite tight at the moment even in zone 4-5 which somebody can easily like. 
Anyways best of luck !!
11/9/22, 08:47 - +91 97178 23927: Room in 2bed 2bath under £1000 including bills with reasonable commute time (<45 min) to central is very difficult. All the best.
11/9/22, 08:49 - +91 99168 56892: Respect that you’re using the word   “Difficult” for somebody who’s yet to come despite the fact you know deep inside that it’s almost “next to impossible”. 😉
11/9/22, 10:34 - +91 86999 97653: Just a heads up while looking for flats that have rent on lower spectrum, look at the energy efficiency rating. Your bills might shoot up more than what you would expect.
11/9/22, 10:41 - +44 7423 793979: I have my ensuite bedroom available for sublet from 28th Nov to 24th Dec.

Please let me know if any one is interested.
11/13/22, 17:56 - +91 96647 01912: Hi, considering reapplying schengen for the second time (planning from France), do they check if we did spend majority of the time in that country before? If yes, how will they check? Do they ask flight/hotel bookings? 
Does their decision for duration of visa change accordingly?
11/13/22, 18:00 - +44 7895 629636: They dont ask for any such thing, they just check entry exit stamp is from which country. Apart from that, they don't have any other information.
11/13/22, 18:02 - +91 96647 01912: I was planning to fly to Geneva and then take a coach into France since that was more convenient for my trip but this could affect the second time visa then yeah?
11/13/22, 18:04 - +44 7895 629636: Possible. But you wont be rejected, they may just give you a visa of shorter validity (3 months instead of 6). But its just my guess from experience.

Niyo for card, and HSBC and Revolut for bank worked like a charm for me.
11/14/22, 14:26 - +91 77740 86822: Been here since 2+ weeks. Did not need cash anytime, and i did not bring cash as well. Open revolut or hsbc, add money from niyo like 10k-20k inr until you get your salary
11/14/22, 14:35 - +91 97178 23927: Forex enough, cash is not required and not accepted at many places. Maybe keep £100 for any emergencies. Niyo is best and most preferred for Forex. Open Revolut or Monzo as soon as you get UK number.

11/15/22, 11:53 - +91 99168 56892: Your phone battery is making your lifestyle expensive 🤯

This is how ola and uber trick you! 

Whenever you try to book a ride and your battery level is less than 20%, they'll show you increased pricing.

The surcharge is as high as 1.5 to 2.1x or even above

Here's what you can learn from this-

When a customer has a problem they are desperate to get out of, they rarely care about money.

When you focus on these kinds of customers(tho a little dark), you make shit tonnes of money.

So, solve a problem and use data insights to make premium profits.

Have you noticed the price hike while your phone is low on battery?
11/15/22, 11:53 - +91 99168 56892: A post from LinkedIn but is this really true ???
11/15/22, 11:56 - +44 7940 156531: No
11/15/22, 11:56 - +44 7940 156531: Been fact checked a few years back iirc
11/15/22, 11:58 - +44 7869 270548: It can be, yes. 

In the past I’ve checked requests being sent from Uber app and they did contain the battery level. They might have stopped it since and/or changed pricing based on battery level
11/15/22, 12:06 - +44 7833 878494: You check the destination twice and price goes up that’s for sure.

11/17/22, 08:08 - +91 86978 18442: If you're joining a critical team for the company, you should generally be safe
11/17/22, 08:09 - +91 86978 18442: In London, the layoff process also takes a significant amount of time (you're still employed for about 5-6 months) and having Apple on your CV should be enough to find a job quickly in the unlikely event of Apple doing layoffs
11/17/22, 09:14 - +91 84590 80129: Interesting. I've a Facebook joining of Feb. In case of another layoff, you're saying I'll be safe for at least 5 months!
11/17/22, 09:16 - +91 99672 88639: There is around 45 days of consulting period during layoff. During these 45 days, you will still be an employee. After this, you have 2 more months on visa.
11/17/22, 09:16 - +91 89999 25637: Even if you get fired you will get good severance ,45 days of employment without work, and huge number of calls from recruiters to hire you. But only if the apple will layoff .

11/18/22, 22:37 - +91 80119 92994: You can maybe open the box and bring them without any problem, but not sure about the exact rules
11/18/22, 22:38 - +91 80119 92994: Or you can just go without declaring. But there can be a random check.

11/19/22, 14:19 - +91 78694 33558: Hi Guys 
Needed some advice
I plan to apply for a EU Schengen VISA.
Background - have 5 EU VISAs in total from 2016 till 2019 (no travels in the EU after 2020). The VISAs were all no more than 45 days (most were 30 days).

Want to ideally apply to a country from where I can maximise my time period (6+ months for sure, ideally 1 year or more..)

Any tips on which country would be good to apply to?
11/19/22, 14:23 - +44 7436 935142: Germany gave me a 6 month visa with only one trip shown
11/19/22, 14:27 - +91 98115 73710: France is safe bet. But i would say go for the embassy for the country, you had travelled in the past
11/19/22, 14:29 - +91 78694 33558: If you/anyone else has applied to France recently, would y'all know how much time is it taking to get the passport back?
11/19/22, 14:32 - +44 7940 156531: First Schengen visa?
11/19/22, 14:32 - +44 7436 935142: Yea
11/19/22, 14:32 - +44 7940 156531: Nice. Thanks!
11/19/22, 14:57 - +91 80119 92994: One week
11/19/22, 15:41 - +44 7833 878494: I don’t about situation right now but whenever I applied, I always book a trip 2-3 months from the current trip for the same country which is general very cheap and tell them with a cover letter that I already have the trip planned and also planning few more in next one year so please 🙏 give me multiple entry one year Visa ! Always worked for me. Worth trying, you can find tickets from £15-£20 for 3-4 months in advance.
11/19/22, 15:44 - +44 7833 878494: One of my friend applied from Italy 2 months back and got it for 2 years, it was 3rd time applying. Another friend around the same time who was also applying for 3rs time has it just for a week so not sure if we can predict anything really
11/20/22, 10:53 - +44 7796 726402: Hey all, my flatmate is letting out his pvt ensuite room in Drayton Park available from 26 November — 3 Nov. The rent is 950 + bills (will be prorated for 1 week) 
The place is 3 stops to Kings cross and has 4 stations close to it.
1. Drayton Park - Great Northern - 2 min
2. Arsenal - Piccadilly - 5 min
3. Holloway Road Station - 9 min
4. Highbury and Islington - 12 min
PostCode - N5 1DS 
DM me if anyone is looking out for a temporary space.
11/20/22, 12:15 - +44 7796 726402: 26 November - 3 December
11/20/22, 13:32 - +91 99908 04845: suggestions needed: 
stay in zone 2 or Travel from zone 3? 

which is the right thing to do?
11/20/22, 13:53 - +91 77740 86822: Travel from zone 5 😎
11/20/22, 14:06 - +91 97939 85367: Considering your office/uni is in Zone 1, you can break it down into factors of what will change if you live in different zones.

1. Travel time to zone 1: Hardly 5-10 min difference one side, Considering you don't change the line, which would add additional waiting and changing time. 

2. Travel cost to zone 1: Assuming you are travelling daily on Weekdays to: Work/uni, weekends: to travel to some place in zone 1 and use tube not rails.
So it will be 22 on-peak round trips 8 off-peak round trips. 
Zone 2-Zone1: 168£
Zone3-Zone1: 188£
You will save just 20£ per month if you live in zone 2

3. Rent of the house in zone 2 vs zone 3: This will be a big deciding factor. I think apartment in zone 2 will cost you 200-400£ extra per month + reduce your chances of finding a good apartment near to good grocery stores & tube station.

So if you live in zone3+ and can travel less to zone1 - best for saving travel time, cost and rent.
11/20/22, 14:08 - +91 97939 85367: By travel less I mean, can work/study from home.
11/20/22, 14:10 - +91 99908 04845: waooo,
11/20/22, 14:10 - +91 99908 04845: such a great explanation

Did anyone convert their Indian HDFC savings account to NRI or NRO ? Which one is preferred? 
Apparently if we already have a savings hdfc we can't convert to NRI, we need to open NRO
11/23/22, 05:44 - +91 91676 67943: we can only convert the already existing savings to NRO, we need to open new NRI *
11/23/22, 07:06 - +91 94422 48023: One needs both nre and nro account
Old one gets converted to NRO while a new NRE account is automatically created. 
Uk to India transfer must be made to NRE
india to India transfers can be made by NRO
11/23/22, 07:06 - +91 94422 48023: Visit the branch and sign the form, they take care of the entire process

11/23/22, 07:09 - +91 94422 48023: We can do it later as well - but not too late. Like it depends on the volume of money being sent back to our personal account in india.

HSBC to HSBC

or

 wise or skrill

11/28/22, 13:40 - +44 7776 651349: I use moneygram, from hsbc to icici
Currency rate is good and usually transferred within 15 20 min on working days

Found it good
11/28/22, 15:53 - +91 80119 92994: I've used wise a couple of times, transaction was instant for me, didn't take more than a min.

12/1/22, 10:18 - +91 97178 23927: yes they do but when generating the policy document, there is no specific date mentioned and I believe you need exact dates mentioned as part of schengen application?

12/2/22, 13:20 - +91 97178 23927: if you've paid the holding deposit to make an offer and your offer is not shortlisted then it will be fully refundable
if your quote was picked and finalised, you might not get the (full) deposit back. check terms and conditions if it were by an agent, they generally put all these conditions in the document which you must have signed
12/2/22, 13:23 - +91 82965 38870: Can someone pls suggest good credit cards for frequent international travel? I heard some cards give complimentary international flight ticket on reaching some milestone or as welcome bonus

12/2/22, 13:45 - +91 86978 18442: Amex platinum is good for frequent travel but the fees is relatively high. Amex's British Airways card is also good as a cheaper option I think

12/2/22, 15:03 - +91 6387 547 833: *Amex Preferred Rewards Gold* is best to start with just £160 fees (free in first year)
You'll get 20k welcome rewards points if you're able to spend 3k in first three months.

And if you try frequently with an specific airline then 
- try BA Amex Premium Plus Card for 25k reward points
- or Virgin Atlantic Reward+ card for 15k flying club points

12/4/22, 15:30 - +44 7824 063660: U might need a booking
12/4/22, 15:30 - +44 7405 367004: This sounds good.
12/4/22, 15:30 - +44 7405 367004: That's fine

12/4/22, 15:32 - +91 98844 88154: This was really good
12/4/22, 15:32 - +44 7423 210151: If you want to impress someone then go for tamarind, gymkhana, brigadier etc .. in case looking for a bit authentic taste with good ambience and not high $ then masala zone, bangalore express, choki dhani etc are good options .. without any ambience and just dhaba style good food - sarvana bhavan, SKVP etc.
12/4/22, 15:48 - +91 80101 55737: Sarvana bhavan, vasanth vilas, a2b... they are family restaurants.. reminds me of 90s
12/4/22, 15:48 - +91 80101 55737: Where's choki Dhani? Is it like the one in jaipur?
12/4/22, 15:48 - +91 80101 55737: They both are good and bit expensive.  Brigadiers doesn't have lot of veg options though.
12/4/22, 15:52 - +44 7502 307298: near Battersea power station, their thalis are good , taste is good overall a tad bit on the expensive side

12/4/22, 15:56 - +44 7423 210151: Not an exact match to the one in Jaipur .. probably 75%

12/6/22, 22:31 - +91 81783 47803: re: France visa application

I have booked two trips - Dec 2022 and May 2023 but while filling the application form on the https://france-visas.gouv.fr/ website. I am not able to list the details about the second trip even after selecting "multiple entry" visa and declaring the number of trips planned as 2. 

Some friends suggested me to share the tickets and hotel confirmations of the second trip during the appointment itself. 

Just wanted to double check if I am doing something wrong while filling the application or this is the expected behaviour?
12/6/22, 22:31 - +44 7824 343230: Have you ever traveled to the Schengen area before?
12/6/22, 22:32 - +91 81783 47803: Nope
12/6/22, 22:32 - +91 6289 015 704: I am planning to travel to Europe in Mid August will I get schengen visa for a year
12/6/22, 22:32 - +91 91679 36009: Expected. There's a description field I think, you can mention details there. And then submit the docs during the appointment
12/6/22, 22:32 - +44 7824 343230: So you can't apply to get a multiple entry Visa
12/6/22, 22:32 - +44 7824 343230: You need to get a single entry visa first
12/6/22, 22:32 - +44 7824 343230: After your first travel, you become eligible to apply for multiple entry visa
12/6/22, 22:33 - +91 91679 36009: Nope you can
12/6/22, 22:33 - +91 98112 66842: I don't think that's how it works.
12/6/22, 22:33 - +91 81783 47803: Two of my friends recd 6 month multiple entry visa on their first application
12/6/22, 22:33 - +91 80101 55737: When I applied for the first time, I got multi entry even though I planned only for once. That was from India btw, don't know if it's different here
12/6/22, 22:34 - +91 81783 47803: thanks!
12/6/22, 22:34 - +91 91679 36009: You can get a multi entry visa on the first try. It sometimes depends on the country, but afaik, France does give you multi entry on the first go
12/6/22, 22:34 - +91 98112 66842: At first go you can most likely get maximum of 6 months visa
12/6/22, 22:34 - +91 81783 47803: thanks for the clarity
12/6/22, 22:36 - +44 7824 343230: Indian passport holders have quite a notorious reputation for overstaying their visas in the Schengen area.. so what you are granted ultimately may vary depending on where you apply from, what is your previous visa history etc.
12/6/22, 23:22 - +91 96168 84305: I believe bank balance that u show is also imp.. if u r just maintaining the min required they may issue visa for short duration only.
12/6/22, 23:22 - +91 73845 65500: Lol, what abt italy
12/6/22, 23:22 - +91 73845 65500: Any idea, I've a recent appointment
12/6/22, 23:23 - +44 7824 343230: It's not the only deciding factor for sure.
12/6/22, 23:39 - +44 7429 214883: I wouldn't recommend showing trips 6 months apart
12/6/22, 23:39 - +44 7429 214883: Technically you're applying for a short stay visa (<90 days)

12/7/22, 02:11 - +91 86748 07262: Why, short stay means we will be staying for a short duration but it does not imply we cant enter multiple times, but i am also planning on showing 2 trips 6 months apart, this will be my first time as well.

12/7/22, 12:52 - +44 7466 617323: Okay
12/7/22, 15:09 - +44 7466 617323: The contract will be a 2-year agreement from 23 Jan 2023 with a 1-year break clause
12/7/22, 15:09 - +44 7466 617323: This term of agreement means one can leave after one year by giving one month notice right ?
12/7/22, 15:10 - +91 97178 23927: yes, exact break clause will be written in your contract, some contracts require people to pay small sum to invoke the break clause

12/8/22, 16:16 - Anirudh Mittal: I had booked France visa appointment and showed trip for Dec end in the online application. I got an appoint for Feb which I just now rescheduled to 15th Dec. 

Question - I probably won't get visa for the Dec trip I had shown in the online application. Is it fine if I show Jan (or later) trip during the actual appointment? Because i guess you can't edit the online application now
12/8/22, 16:17 - +44 7429 214883: You can change the application form

12/9/22, 09:34 - +44 7423 210151: Nurseries are private in UK unlike primary schools that are both pvt and public. For nurseries, contact ones that are local in your area. You can go to their website and also check what ofsted rating they have, which is an indicator of how good they are. Also, read online review on mumsnet about these. In terms of paying for nurseries, if you are on a visa here then I don’t think you are eligible for govt funding but just double-check to make sure.

12/9/22, 22:03 - +91 70603 34198: There's a surcharge on some nights. Search for it, you'll find it.

12/9/22, 23:27 - +44 7466 617323: You’ll easily get it. Sometimes even after tapping, it does not get captured and hence full fare can be charged. Happened to me but got refunded easily.
12/10/22, 00:11 - +91 94552 22973: Anyone up for tomorrow?

12/12/22, 15:34 - +91 98849 00086: 100 ml and make sure it packed properly with the air tight packs so they don't stress much on removing and doing a check
12/12/22, 15:35 - +91 98849 00086: oh wait , you said checking ( in that case ) it doesn't matter
12/12/22, 15:35 - +91 98849 00086: could take 500ml also ( i have done it myself ) 3 bottles of 150 each )

12/12/22, 15:39 - +91 77740 86822: Possible scams in this group. Please be vigilant. One of my friends posted regarding looking for a room. Possible scammer from the group called and said they are renting with some other person and that person is not able to rent now. He insisted my friend to pay the holding deposit to book the apartment asap giving a reason that they need to create agreement on the same day. My friend said he cannot give deposit unless he views the apartment and left the conversation. 

So please be vigilant while dealing and never pay unless you see the apartment and verify.
12/12/22, 16:09 - +91 76800 49090: @917774086822 are you referring to this one ? Because I posted this, and 3 people reached out to me at the same time. And I went ahead with booking the flat along with @919901372853
12/12/22, 16:12 - +91 76800 49090: I believe Charles Vinodh was another person who was interested
12/12/22, 16:14 - +91 77740 86822: No not referring to anyone. Just cautioning so that people take care.
12/12/22, 16:36 - +91 76800 49090: Guys, any good recommendation for Tuxedo renting places ?
12/12/22, 16:39 - +91 96168 84305: Plz be vigilant BUT don't forget that this is pretty normal in UK. To new people it is weird to not pay for the property until they physically view it but u don't get that luxury in London market always.. Yes, it is risky but the holding deposit works that way.
12/12/22, 16:42 - +91 97178 23927: Would recommend doing against that. It's a good idea to wait for sometime because unlike India where we can get off the property by just giving ~1 month notice, here lease is binding and you're practically stuck for the duration of your lease. So, do try to see the property atleast once before signing your contract/paying holding deposit.
12/12/22, 16:43 - +44 7895 629636: I would disagree. Better to view the property, area etc and then decide. Yes it may take more time and energy, but much safer than signing a 1 year contract and getting stuck in it.
12/12/22, 16:48 - +91 96168 84305: Yes, I understand why it's imp and definitely it should be done.. but it's a problem when u r teaming up with a stranger nd expecting that u ll get multiple viewings ..

Just get things sorted in 1 viewing is what I would recommend
12/12/22, 16:50 - +91 77740 86822: I would say better be safe than sorry. The scammers take advantage of this situation which is there in the market right now. In another case, my friend’s friend got duped by some fake agency after the property was viewed virtually. So better to view in person and then decide.

12/12/22, 18:48 - +44 7423 210151: Ask your landlord to use openrent .. its cheaper and secure way for tenants for deposits as well.
12/12/22, 18:49 - +44 7423 210151: Unless you really trust the landlord, it is not advisable to pay deposit directly into their personal account
12/12/22, 19:12 - +44 7466 617323: Never pay holding deposit without viewing physically/live virtual. I wanted to book without viewing Ans agency denied saying I need to either see it virtually or physically. Any genuine agency or landlord won’t let without the actual viewing.

12/13/22, 14:12 - +44 7429 214883: You can withdraw cash directly from the ATM machine there. That's what I did. The machine charged me €3 when I withdrew 200. And my bank did not charge me anything. So it was a good deal imo
12/13/22, 14:12 - +44 7423 210151: When going to India from London .. are any Covid formalities (testing, air suvidha, vaccination proof) required ?
12/13/22, 14:15 - +44 7429 214883: There are lots of currency exchange shops in London too. They don't charge too much either.
12/13/22, 14:22 - +44 7429 214883: Just make sure you don't select the atm's conversation charges and withdraw in euros. Your bank's rates would definitely be better than that. I used monzo it has 0 commission

12/13/22, 15:16 - +91 98338 07887: If you go directly to a big bank's ATM then the 3€ charge isn't there. So then it's basically whatever Mastercard/Visa are charging to convert if you are using Monzo.
12/13/22, 15:33 - +91 97178 23927: USD to INR also all time high
12/13/22, 15:37 - +91 82965 38870: Saving account gets converted to NRO and a separate account gets opened called NRE
12/13/22, 15:37 - +91 82965 38870: This is what icici and indusind bank told me
12/13/22, 15:50 - +91 86978 18442: Don't think so, USD fell against everything instead

12/13/22, 15:51 - +91 86978 18442: As that means that Fed might avoid rate hikes

12/13/22, 16:04 - +91 99672 88639: If you want to send the foreign money to India, you will send it to a NRE account. If you have some sources of earning in India(rent, dividends, fd etc), that should go to the NRO account.
12/13/22, 16:07 - +91 94455 47799: Your existing account will be converted to NRO and a new NRE account will be created ... So you will have two accounts NRO/NRE
12/13/22, 16:39 - +27 81 475 4314: Yeah you current saving needs to be converted to NRO ... NRE can be a new account that gets opened separately
12/13/22, 16:39 - +27 81 475 4314: You can send money to your NRE from outside
12/13/22, 16:40 - +27 81 475 4314: Use your NRO to get earnings in India
12/13/22, 16:41 - +44 7867 237365: Also, is it illegal to send money back to normal indian account?
12/13/22, 16:42 - +91 89872 83049: No I think its fine to send back to NRO/NRE but you can only send funds outside india via NRE account
12/13/22, 16:58 - +27 81 475 4314: Nothing is illegal till you have proof of funds
12/13/22, 16:59 - +91 84590 80129: My friend sent and he is doing okay but I think that may not be the case always
12/13/22, 17:04 - +91 98849 00086: It is not illegal, but it is NOT advisable . When you are NRE you are supposed to open a NRE account and do a pay in and out from foreign transfers in it for better transparency and to get less headache in future.

Its also easy to state that the income was derived from you from working in foreign..
12/13/22, 17:10 - +91 99672 88639: Having a savings account is illegal for a NRI. The only option then left is to send money to the NRE account.
12/13/22, 17:11 - +44 7867 237365: I moved to UK on October 29, so I should be OK for 182 days since that right?
12/13/22, 17:13 - +91 99672 88639: Yes, that should be ok in my opinion. But do it asap to avoid the confusion.
12/13/22, 17:16 - +91 96168 84305: Also I was informed that the interest earned on money in NRE account is tax free. So while filing taxes u can ignore it. Probably not the same for NRO. U can consult a tax advisor for complete info.

12/13/22, 17:41 - +91 77740 86822: Yes will be okay. But you have to declare UK income while filing tax in India and get an exemption using DTAA. Once you become NRI, no need to show UK income to indian tax authorities.
12/13/22, 17:59 - +91 97178 23927: and from NRE we can send money to other normal account like our parent's right?
12/13/22, 18:00 - +91 99672 88639: Yes. But don’t do vice versa.
12/13/22, 18:00 - +91 97178 23927: Got it, thanks for the info.
12/13/22, 18:18 - +91 94455 47799: If you fall in say 30% tax bracket in India and say you fall in 20% tax bracket in UK you are still expected to pay the difference 10% of your UK income to India ..

12/14/22, 08:37 - +91 99672 88639: NRE account is supposed to take foreign money and it then converts into inr at bank rates. If you want to send inr to india, transfer it to NRO account. You do have to take care of tax declarations and all in nro account.

12/14/22, 09:56 - +91 96168 84305: We can transfer INR as well to NRE account.. I did that using remitly.
Ideally u should transfer money from foreign sources to NRE acc with(remitly,wise, etc) or without conversion(that's when bank rates apply)

12/14/22, 10:41 - +91 98115 73710: But is it okay to transfer to nre using wise in inr currency? Does nre account accept that? (This would be if we dont want bank’s exchange rate)
12/14/22, 10:41 - +91 80101 55737: I transferred inr through wise. It got accepted
12/14/22, 10:45 - +91 98115 73710: Ok thank you. That was my only concern. Whether it accepts or not
12/14/22, 10:46 - +91 80101 55737: I transferred £10 first, just to be double sure

12/14/22, 11:22 - +91 97939 85367: I have read and heard from many people and even from SBI bank that after 6 months your all resident banks(savings + current) will be converted to NRO automatically. I dont know how do they track the timeliness. Even I am not sure whether this is 100% true. But something which you should check once.
12/14/22, 11:24 - +1 (226) 792-6466: i've been away from india for 5+ years, hasn't happened yet
12/14/22, 11:31 - +91 90133 32219: There's no such complication that I faced when converting a Savings account (being used for Stocks, MF, EPF, UPI) to NRO. As long as your account number and branch (and hence, IFSC code) doesn't change, it should be seamless to convert the account. 
If it helps, I had my KYC done for EPF while it was a resident savings account and was  successfully able to claim the amount even after it got converted to NRO. I still actively perform transactions using my demat account, etc. UPI was also seamless, just make sure to not even give them your international number (at least during conversion) because I've heard of an incident when they updated the primary number even though the request was only for updating the contact details (and UPI doesn't work with international numbers)
12/14/22, 11:44 - +91 97939 85367: Thanks. I have couple of questions:

- how did you convert your savings account to NRO?
- Do you send funds from UK to the same NRO account? Or you have a separate NRE account?
- Have you ever transfered funds from UK to savings account (before it was converted to NRO account) are there any tax liabilities or penalties?
12/14/22, 11:50 - +91 97939 85367: And I also have a general question to Zerodha Kite users. Have you folks got your resident Zerodha converted to a PIS/Non-PIS account (something equivalent to NRE/NRO) after coming to UK? Or are you operating it as a resident Zerodha account only?

Do you know if there are any penalties associated with it if you don't convert?

I have asked this question to tax consultancy Vialto provided by my employer. They said that there is no tax liabilities though, but they were not sure about the penalties which broker can charge if they find an NRI operating a resident account.
12/14/22, 11:52 - +44 7867 261058: Anyone coming to London from India in the next couple of days? Need some medicine urgently.

- You can transfer from UK to NRO as well but I would recommend against it because anything via NRE channel is tax free. If and when required, you can easily transfer from NRE to NRO but not vice versa. Check the video Shivam sent this morning on this group to understand more.
- International transfer to resident savings account is also possible but take some advice from a consultant if it's in your name and you're officially an NRI (staying out of india for >182 days) because it's not allowed as per RBI and frequent transactions are easier to get flagged (just my guess). If the resident account belongs to one of your relatives, i think it's considered as a gift and there's no tax liability upto certain limits (I'm not an expert in this, so better confirm with a CA)

12/14/22, 15:37 - +91 90133 32219: They were converted to NRO deposits in my case but its nothing magical. Bank staff will break your FD and create a new one with the prevailing interest rate, so better to do it on your own as some banks might not do that for you.
12/14/22, 17:34 - +91 82001 06857: Has anyone travelled to Schengen area except visiting the country that issued the visa? Can this be a problem in subsequent applications?
12/14/22, 17:46 - +44 7895 629636: If the country which issued the visa is not your 1st or last country - then it would not be stamped on your passport anyway. So this won't make a difference to your future applications.
12/14/22, 17:49 - +44 7940 156531: Not a problem
12/14/22, 17:53 - +91 82001 06857: What all past information is asked in future applications? Dates of last travel, countries visited, country which issued visa?

12/14/22, 18:09 - Anirudh Mittal: For Schengen visa appointment, how do you show cancellable flight tickets? None of the flight options I see are refundable
12/14/22, 18:11 - +91 97178 23927: Same question for hotels. Airbnb and booking generally ask card details
12/14/22, 18:12 - Anirudh Mittal: But they don't charge you if you cancel before arriving
12/14/22, 18:13 - +91 95607 72474: We booked Business Premier Train ticket from Eurostar. It was fully refundable
12/14/22, 18:13 - +44 7940 156531: Book business class flight tickets. The most expensive ones. Those are fully refundable on most airlines. Check the conditions before booking. It's ridiculously expensive and blocks your money for a few weeks
12/14/22, 18:14 - +44 7940 156531: Booking.com is fine. Just book something where you'll have to pay a couple of days before the trip. Fully refundable
12/14/22, 18:15 - +91 80101 55737: I wish I knew this earlier. I made standard premier booking 🥲
12/14/22, 18:17 - Anirudh Mittal: When you cancel just before the trip also? I can see "can upto 60 days before departure" clause
12/14/22, 18:18 - +91 95607 72474: We cancelled just after getting the visa
12/14/22, 18:21 - Anirudh Mittal: Oh my bad
It says "60 days after the planned departure"
12/14/22, 18:28 - +44 7895 629636: You can also book flexible economy class flights. But not all airlines have those.
12/14/22, 18:29 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Klm/af have those
12/14/22, 18:30 - +44 7895 629636: And you will have to check directly on airline's page and book from there.

12/15/22, 13:41 - +44 7895 629636: Have you checked against the rate provided by Tranferwise (in % terms)? Wise is usually one of the cheapest.
12/15/22, 13:55 - +91 98208 88583: I tried that as well but their rate is good but there is a conversion fee. I did a lot of reasearch and convined with the sbi stuffs i do. The app and website works fine to transfer funds. Its get irritating at times becoz of so many security question and protection they keep on website to avoud fraud.
12/15/22, 13:55 - +91 98208 88583: Which is good but sometimes gets too much
12/15/22, 13:55 - +91 74249 47030: I have one extra ticket for the Wicked musical show today @ 7:30 PM. Please DM if interested
12/15/22, 14:44 - +91 97939 85367: Thanks. But someone mentioned in the group that you cant have savings account in India if you are an NRI. You have to get that coverted to NRO account first? 
So have you checked with SBI if there is any penalties if you are transferring funds from SBI UK account to SBI savings account in India?
12/15/22, 15:34 - +91 98208 88583: There is no such thing. I am in uk from last 6 months and not any penalities to be paid. Please remember rule of thumb ie bring money into india is not taxed however when u take money out of india lots of measures needs to managed that is ur tax status, dividend tax or capital tax on proceeds etc. in my option i hv faced no problems at all
12/15/22, 17:24 - +44 7895 629636: I look at it this way -> sending money to India is a one way route, its very cumbersome to move it anywhere outside of india then.
12/15/22, 17:27 - +91 98208 88583: Not really u pay for conversion charges n bank fees then u r sorted. Else used the old way of transferring money in 60s was the hawala way🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪

Thats normal
12/16/22, 18:13 - +44 7459 511980: Yeah! They won't really let you take it without making a payment. You can apply for a reconsideration right after that though.

12/16/22, 18:58 - +44 7459 511980: You need to post them some form. It's on the website. Idk what's the success rate of them refunding but that is the only way

Could you please let me know what all medicine and eatable are not allowed to carry in checked in bags from India to LHR? 

How much quantity is allowed for medicine (Allopathy/Homeopathy) and for eatable?
12/19/22, 15:43 - +91 80587 88422: Try ordering from Apollo Pharmacy online, a doctor will call you and write the required prescription for all prescription-based medicines. With prescription, things should be alright just in case there is a check. I travelled on Friday and no one asked anything about medicines.
12/19/22, 15:44 - +91 96500 18699: Thanks for your inputs

12/21/22, 09:43 - +91 98849 00086: Lebara 
Lyca 
Vodafone 

All are same they have low coverage and 5G is not everywhere

Plus frequent call disconnects

I would suggest O2 or EE ( based on the suggestions I got from my friends )
12/21/22, 09:43 - +44 7438 321212: It is average. Like if you compare the speed with other network providers, you will realise how bad it is

12/22/22, 14:16 - +44 7895 629636: France, belgium, spain, are considered safe. I don't think you can do anything to improve your chances of getting a 6 month visa. Afaik.

I am Sampada Jain, I am working in central London, my landlord is ending the contract early this jan31st so I am looking for space for myself for now I am okay with either double room (I would live alone) or 2/3 bedrooms flat, I feel I might get some flatmates. Please help me if anyone has any leads.

12/26/22, 07:25 - +91 70156 58367: Apparently the rule is that you have to apply through the Country you'll be spending the most number of days in but you can make fully refundable bookings and apply through whichever country you want.
I applied through Spain, got my visa in 2 weeks

12/28/22, 19:42 - +44 7879 996571: It’s UW - Utility warehouse
12/28/22, 19:42 - +91 98849 00086: I assume its precalculations based on the previous usage… 
And you should get your refund by year end or based on your contract date
12/28/22, 19:43 - +44 7895 629636: Octopus energy, edf etc don't charge it.
12/28/22, 19:43 - +44 7879 996571: Yeah but it’s that we don’t have a prior experience with this provider and this deposit makes it like a 12 months contract
12/28/22, 20:50 - +44 7704 930146: Is it a fixed bill one?
12/28/22, 21:44 - +44 7879 996571: Not sure what fixed bill one is but wesa toh nhi lag rha

1/1/23, 17:37 - +91 76800 49090: Sometimes they do ask for a proof other than right-to-rent code
1/1/23, 17:38 - +91 76800 49090: if you've just moved to UK
1/1/23, 17:38 - +91 6289 015 704: Yes that’s fine but is it ok to give them photocopy or only show the hard copy
1/1/23, 17:38 - +91 76800 49090: also in xthe case the third party firm that's verifying your details is taking more time than needed.

1/1/23, 17:41 - +91 76800 49090: yeah not quite sure, did not happen to us. But if you run a quick check about the agency online and if you find some satisfying reviews about them, I believe there's no harm in it.

1/3/23, 11:00 - +91 70153 28353: Is it a common practice here for landlords to ask for 2-3 month rent upfront along with security deposit ?
1/3/23, 11:01 - +44 7824 343230: Visa required.
1/3/23, 11:01 - +44 7903 678132: No
1/3/23, 11:01 - +44 7903 678132: The security deposit cannot exceed 5 weeks rent
1/3/23, 11:03 - +44 7776 697374: Thats not only not common, thats also not legal
1/3/23, 11:03 - +44 7704 930146: its quite common for students from what people told me , one landlord told me some students were willing to pay full 6 months . Deposit cannot be more than 5 weeks
1/3/23, 11:03 - +44 7903 678132: Yes that's illegal
1/3/23, 11:04 - +44 7466 617323: People are ready to pay 12 months upfront due to house crunch. Of course it is not legal but right now anything is happening
1/3/23, 11:05 - +44 7466 617323: Ideally, one month advanced and 5 weeks deposit is required.
1/3/23, 11:05 - +91 99875 77153: Asking for security deposit worth more than 5week rent is illegal, asking for rent is not illegal.
1/3/23, 11:05 - +44 7824 343230: I've been a student in London, and my University said you just need to show your student status letter and give a security deposit. You should be paying rent monthly in advance.
1/3/23, 11:07 - +91 97177 79412: +1 , deposit can't be greater than 5 weeks and has to be stored in a tenancy deposit scheme, 

But landlord can ask for X months rent in advance , it's a bit common these days due to the house crunch.
1/3/23, 11:09 - +91 99875 77153: If you have other options, you should walk away.

HSBC and other UK banks will ask for a passport, stamped visa, proof of address(bank stmt/council tax/utility bills/bonafide letter from your company).
I opened my account in ICICI uk(only passport and stamped visa is required). Got my account number, sort code, userId within 5mins. But the debit card and pin will come from India, so it will take 7-10days. Later with icici bank statement you can apply for uk credit cards.

1/5/23, 08:36 - +44 7895 629636: That's not really a constructive way of improving a city. Its like saying if you live here you are not allowed to mention the negatives, so you better leave if you find some things lacking.
1/5/23, 08:37 - +91 97178 23927: I don’t think saying weather and taxes are bad will improve them either.

We are looking for a third person who would want to join two male working professionals (joining Deloitte in next 2 weeks) to find a suitable 3 bed (preferably all double bed) apartment in and around New Street Square. We have also found a few options, but would need someone's confirmation before we reach out to the respective agents. We can mutually decide the rent range, however we shall prioritize folks who would be willing to move in by the last week of jan, or early feb, in order to divide the rent up from the first month only.

Please let me know if you are interested or have any leads.
Thank you ^.^

I was not asked for receipts

1/5/23, 16:29 - +91 98849 00086: Depends on your preference or the genre of music Or more specifically for what purpose you want it..
Movie or gaming etc..

*in my opinion ) Bose has a subtle soundstage ( mostly good for movies ) 
Marshall is good for rock and pop ( lacks bass ) if you are a bass head 

Jbl is also a good consideration for the pricing and sturdy build... ( has a good amount of bass ) 

There is a Bose soundbar which I have used personally ( solo 5 or something ) which has a good detailed production of voice and music especially much recommended for TVs and if you are more into movies...

I assumed you didn't mention portable , so I would prefer soundbars of anytype Bose or marshall .. You can also give it a try in currys and try asking the agents their who might have more info...
1/5/23, 16:30 - +91 98849 00086: But if you are looking for portable ( JBL is best for price ) bose would give you most value but higher on the pricing , 
I would also suggest ANKER which is a wonderful option with good pricing
1/5/23, 16:38 - +91 98849 00086: The bose soundlink mini II is a good option 
A bit heavy but delivers good music

We have used it in outdoors in parks
1/5/23, 16:39 - +91 98849 00086: Marshall emberton is an entry level portable speaker 
My friend has it 
I couldnt comment more on the music quality and loudness

Could check with him if possible
1/5/23, 16:45 - +44 7466 617323: Thanks a lot . Most of the friends recommended Marshall though Bose is I personally like.
1/5/23, 16:46 - +44 7704 930146: is 10k rupees worth on Bluetooth speakers?
1/5/23, 16:47 - +44 7704 930146: emberton are approx 100 pounds here
1/5/23, 16:48 - +91 98849 00086: I would suggest to listen to both of em or tske a look at currys and then decide
1/5/23, 16:48 - +44 7466 617323: Any good one will cost more than this. But again depends
1/5/23, 17:13 - +44 7903 678132: Is a transit visa required for Poland?

1/7/23, 13:54 - +91 80587 88422: Any VPN where Hotstar India works?
1/7/23, 14:18 - +44 7776 697374: Surfshark. But dont expect blazing fast speeds
1/7/23, 15:13 - +91 97939 85367: I use ExpressVPN. And it is very good. I have streamed Live Premier league matches on Hotstar, Pakistan NZ test match and BBL on SonyLiv, Ligue1 match on Voot. 

Hotstar: I never faced any buffering issue. Although live Hotstar video quality is terrible they show content in 25fps 1080p which sucks. But no issue of connectivity.

SonyLiv: Quality is good, works seamlessly

Voot: Live Sports Quality itself is poor, sometimes it buffers. But live channels like MTV Beats works seamlessly. 


Zee5: There is no live sport content on this app, but live channels and regular video works OK, sometimes buffers on FHD but never on HD.

1/11/23, 16:31 - +91 82965 38870: Is oyster and railcard the same thing? Do we get them online or we get that on station?
1/11/23, 16:33 - +91 80101 55737: different. oyster - station or local shop; railcard - online
1/11/23, 16:33 - +91 80101 55737: do link your railcard with oyster for extra discounts
1/11/23, 16:33 - +44 7867 237365: Oyster in rail station, railcard online. You can link them in the station by asking staff for assistance
1/11/23, 16:33 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: Oyster card is used on the tube/overground/trains in the London area. 

Railcard is for the trains that connects you to places outside London too. 

Both are different things. Railcard entitles you to a discount on your rail journeys, and you can link it with your oyster card to get discount on your tube journeys as well.
1/11/23, 16:34 - Anirudh Mittal: -- ChatGPT
1/11/23, 16:35 - +91 80101 55737: google for rail card discount code before purchasing your railcard. I got 30% off
1/11/23, 16:35 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: Get well soon bro :P
1/11/23, 16:36 - +91 82965 38870: After linking railcard to oyster, I can use either cards for any journey ?
1/11/23, 16:37 - +91 80101 55737: Railcard is virtual
1/11/23, 16:37 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: A rail card is not a physical thing
1/11/23, 16:37 - +91 80101 55737: you need physical oyster card or app for tube
1/11/23, 16:38 - Kshitij Chauhan E&C: You’ll continue to use your oyster cards for everything.

When you’re booking train tickets online for travelling outside London, you can check a box saying that you have a rail card to receive a discount. Then when you’re travelling, you’ll have to show it to the ticket checker using the rail card app.
1/11/23, 17:40 - +44 7895 629636: Have they ever checked anyone's railcard? :)
1/11/23, 17:41 - +44 7824 063660: Yes, a lot of times they do
1/11/23, 18:08 - +91 86690 91448: Always actually. Their scanner beeps if it detects your ticket needs a railcard
1/11/23, 18:47 - +44 7405 367004: Yes link it, it charges it you less. A TFL employee told me and linked my card to oyster.
1/11/23, 18:59 - +44 7869 270548: You get 1/3rd off on tube in off peak hours (if you link your oyster with your railcard)
1/11/23, 19:04 - +91 90133 32219: App? Is there an app we can use instead of the physical oyster card?😯
1/11/23, 20:32 - +91 98530 94744: I took train to canary wharf and other day at same peak hour i went to another zone1 station, i paid £2.5 extra the previous day.
Not sure why.
1/11/23, 21:29 - +44 7867 056289: You can check on tfl.gov.uk

1/12/23, 00:58 - +91 95016 22311: If you are traveling during peak hours then Google Pay as railcard discount doesn't apply
1/12/23, 07:43 - +44 7869 270548: Yeah but the daily or weekly cap wouldn’t work if you use different cards
1/12/23, 07:52 - +91 97110 90746: I don't know if we can add rail card to contactless debit/credit card. Same was said by TFL https://twitter.com/TfL/status/1289583763924504576?s=20&t=1cs82xnLcOkL7iBXw8br7w

It depends a normal triban from decathalon basic with shimano sora should cost you 500 to 600 pounds...

if you need a light weight ones giant or cannandalo it should be more than 1K 

if you are really into racing and need carbon bikes it would cost you more than 2K

1/14/23, 11:50 - +44 7940 156531: No I've tried that with Austria before and they gave a long visa. But I've heard France give out 6 months visas pretty easily so you can try that

1/14/23, 12:29 - +91 80101 55737: depends on the country you intend to visit

1/14/23, 12:30 - +44 7405 506385: I want to visit sweden and france and amsterdam
1/14/23, 12:31 - +91 80101 55737: so you have to apply from one of these countries in this order:
1. country of longest stay
2. if more than one country has same number of days then the port of entry or port of exit
3. if neither of them is port of entry/exit, you can apply for any of the country with longest stay
1/14/23, 12:32 - +91 80101 55737: some embassies have outsourced the application process to VFS or TLS
1/14/23, 12:33 - +91 80101 55737: so you need to first get appointment with embassy/consulate/tls/vfs (whatever is applicable)
submit your application with supporting docs
wait for the results
1/14/23, 12:54 - +44 7405 506385: Cool so like its the same process i guess
1/14/23, 12:55 - +44 7405 506385: First fill the form with country specific site and take appointment from vfs right??
1/14/23, 13:00 - +44 7895 629636: You can check for appointment before filling the entire form
1/14/23, 13:00 - +44 7405 506385: Ok
1/14/23, 13:08 - +44 7405 506385: France is not showing up in this list

1/14/23, 13:15 - +44 7405 506385: So from which country shall I apply then
1/14/23, 13:31 - +44 7440 478215: also, is it okay if I book an appointment for (or apply for) norway just to get the schengen visa but not visit norway?

1/18/23, 19:04 - +91 98696 95281: Hello All,
I have found an amazing 2 bedroom hall kitchen flat in Central London (SE11BH)
The flat is on the 3rd floor. It has 2 bedrooms, two bathrooms and a spacious common living area and kitchen. There is ample storage area and the kitchen has three platform sides. It is available from mid February. The owner is ready to fix the rent for long term and hence, the rent won’t shoot up post a year. The rent is £2,500 for the whole flat.

Looking for someone to rent the place with. Please DM me if you are interested

1/18/23, 19:05 - +44 7895 629636: A general advice would be to change your address everywhere whenever you move - bank account, credit card, electoral register etc. :)

So the flat is going to be painted fresh and carpets are going to be changed

What if one gets out of airport in Mumbai and wants to check-in with duty free items bought from Heathrow?
1/19/23, 18:40 - +44 7940 156531: If you don't leave the airport not a problem. If you do, not sure. Never tried that
1/19/23, 18:44 - +91 82001 06857: Will it be different though as it's the same procedure for carry on bags for connecting flight or you are boarding for the first time?
1/19/23, 18:46 - +44 7940 156531: Once you've left the airport I doubt they'll care whether it's duty free or not. After that it's bringing liquid onto a flight from outside and that's not allowed. When you're connecting it's the same journey. Keep the receipt from duty free with you and they'll let you carry it.

My friend is on US  F-1 student visa and she is traveling from india to US ,  with layover in london.

Does she need to take UK visa to come out of london airport ?
1/20/23, 12:19 - +91 97013 57418: Tried googling , but there were mixed answers
1/20/23, 12:20 - +91 80101 55737: Not an expert here, but if you want to come outside the airport, you should need a visa
1/20/23, 12:26 - +91 78694 33558: You ideally need a VISA but a friend of mine had the same situation, he just went to the Immigration Officers, explained his situation (that he had a US VISA, a long layover - the same as yours) and was allowed to leave and re-enter LHR - so worth checking with them at the Immigration / VISA checking line/office!
1/20/23, 12:40 - +91 97013 57418: Cool, thanks

I'm a 25 year old software engineer, looking for a 2 bedroom place. I'd prefer a private bathroom, but open to sharing it as well. My budget is £900-1200 a month.

While I currently live in Elephant and Castle, I'm looking for a place in Hampstead Heath/Stratford/North Greenwich/Wembley, but I don't mind any areas as long as it's an easy commute to central London. I'm quite clean and organized, like cooking, and always up for a bike ride! :)

1/25/23, 14:30 - +91 98869 86684: Hey guys,

I found a room in a shared flat on Facebook marketplace. I viewed the room yesterday someone showed me the room who claims to be a tenant there. I asked if I can meet the landlord before paying the deposit but he says he doesn’t stay in London and he wants me to pay the deposit online and he will sent me the tenancy agreement after that and later I can pay the full rent and collect the keys from a tenant when I move in. I don’t know if I can trust this person I don’t have any details of him. What should I do in this case?
1/25/23, 14:32 - +91 80101 55737: Does this involve an agent?
1/25/23, 14:32 - +91 98869 86684: No
1/25/23, 14:32 - +91 98869 86684: He says he’s the landlord
1/25/23, 14:33 - +91 80101 55737: Please be careful. FB marketplace anyways has a large number of fraudsters
1/25/23, 14:34 - +91 80101 55737: For me the process was same - pay the holding deposit and then get the tenancy agreement. I actually paid in cash. However, I met the landlord in person at the property.
1/25/23, 14:35 - +91 94455 47799: Check if the bank account is a proper bank account that involves address verification .. not just an online bank account like revoult or monzo ..
1/25/23, 14:35 - +91 94455 47799: Also make sure to talk to other tenants in the room .. in the property
1/25/23, 14:40 - +91 80101 55737: This should be added to the renting guide
1/25/23, 14:41 - +44 7833 878494: I did the same, there is generally a weeks deposit if you can start referencing right away to hold the property and thn you pay rent or anything else once your reference gets through. I shared flat where the girl was in India and referencing took 3 weeks so she paid the whole deposit to me to hold the property. But Definitely take everything in writing over the email exactly the way you discussed. If possible ask her to cc landlord on that communication. That’s what I did so there is more transparency
1/25/23, 14:43 - +44 7833 878494: Mine was through agency so I looped her in the moment she paid the deposit and started the ref. check which only completed when she came to London but it hardly takes a week for ref. Check.

1/25/23, 16:20 - +91 98990 08719: Very specific question
I doubt you will find one that late 🥲
10pm is too late even for outer zones
1/25/23, 16:21 - +91 98990 08719: By outer zones I mean places like east ham

1/25/23, 20:49 - +44 7405 506385: If I transfer lets say 2k pounds from outside uk
1/25/23, 20:49 - +44 7405 506385: Do i need to pay tax on that
1/25/23, 20:49 - +44 7405 506385: To my uk bank account
1/25/23, 20:52 - +91 88020 58589: Depends on your residence status for that FY and whether that money you’re transferring was already taxed.

Assuming the amount you’re transferring is just to get settled here, and it was already taxed, it won’t be taxed again.
1/25/23, 20:52 - +44 7405 506385: No let’s say someone fromUS is transferring
1/25/23, 20:52 - +44 7405 506385: That money is not taxed
1/25/23, 20:53 - +44 7405 506385: And what if i directly transfer the money to my ISA account
1/25/23, 20:53 - +44 7405 506385: Will that be taxed
1/25/23, 20:54 - +91 88020 58589: Well, in that case afaik it depends on the tax regime you’ve opted for. There’s some relief I guess, so even if that amount is your overseas income, if it’s below 2000 you don’t pay the tax.
1/25/23, 20:54 - +91 81208 93207: Oh alright
1/25/23, 20:55 - +91 88020 58589: I don’t think it matter where the money ends up, as soon as you bring it into UK you’re liable to declare it (if it’s your income and not taxed). Again take my words with a grain of salt, it’d be better if you consult some professional as it can get pretty complicated at times 😅

1/26/23, 01:17 - +91 81303 69260: Which place has appointments available rn? Also which country gives longer visas
1/26/23, 01:17 - +91 81303 69260: Schengen
1/26/23, 01:35 - +44 7895 629636: Yeah need to call and ask for price, appointment etc.
1/26/23, 07:14 - +44 7869 270548: You can also consider doing an online appointment with a dentist in India (using Practo). IF it can help to just talk and understand more. Though any medicine they prescribe, you can’t get it in the UK as international prescriptions are not allowed here.
1/26/23, 07:15 - +44 7869 270548: Also I think what you might consider an emergency might not match with their definition of one. So it would be nice to call and describe the issue to book an appointment (if it’s a dentist in London)
1/26/23, 09:02 - +44 7940 156531: Ya inka definition of emergency is agar 10 min ke andar mar nai rahe toh 2 mahine baad milegi appointment

1/26/23, 11:01 - +44 7436 038094: They might ask for return ticket at the immigration
1/26/23, 11:02 - +44 7436 038094: When you apply for visa, you don't need the tickets but need to show sufficient funds that you can afford return tickets and stay in London
1/26/23, 11:03 - +91 80939 26811: Ya during immigration its fine.. i heard visa is denied if there is no purpose of them for going back😒
1/26/23, 11:04 - +91 93732 36438: What documents should we carry along before coming to UK?
1/26/23, 11:04 - +44 7436 038094: You can show current rent agreements to establish that they stay there
1/26/23, 11:05 - +91 80101 55737: This is possible. One of friend got his Canada visa denied for this.

1/26/23, 11:38 - +91 80101 55737: You just need to show that they (or you) can take care of the whole trip expense. And they have strong ties with the home country so they have a reason to return
1/26/23, 12:51 - +44 7502 307298: Hi,

1/26/23, 18:21 - +91 97177 79412: I think if u do by cash , not by card or oyster
1/26/23, 18:22 - +44 7776 651349: I think there's a 9£ cap on daily travel in tube
No way it should cost that
1/26/23, 18:25 - +91 88618 97183: Which line are you taking ?
1/26/23, 18:27 - +44 7442 254176: Jubilee, only the machine shows that while booking tickets
1/26/23, 18:27 - +44 7903 242088: From Stratford?
1/26/23, 18:27 - +44 7903 242088: They're both in the same zone
1/26/23, 18:27 - +44 7442 254176: Figured it out, gonna use debit card directly on the gates
1/26/23, 18:27 - +44 7903 242088: It shouldn't be more than 1.6
1/26/23, 18:28 - +44 7903 242088: Or 1.8 whatever that is 😅
1/26/23, 18:29 - +91 88618 97183: That's with the Railcard or without?
1/26/23, 18:29 - +44 7442 254176: Machine's broken I think
1/26/23, 18:29 - +44 7903 242088: If you're taking the tube, with oyster or any contactless, it should be 1.6 normally and 1.8 peak
1/26/23, 18:30 - +44 7903 242088: Oh maybe, can call or email for refund if extra for deducted
1/26/23, 18:31 - +44 7442 254176: Didn't pay after seeing the amount ☠️

1/27/23, 15:31 - +44 7440 737668: Hello! I've been trying to open a bank account but all the banks I've tried required an address proof. I am currently in temporary housing so I don't really have an address.
I've got revolut set up meanwhile but I would really appreciate any help about how I could set up a proper bank account without an address
1/27/23, 15:33 - +44 7704 352635: You can give office address and get it opened. Later you can update the address
1/27/23, 15:34 - +91 87686 68885: I got my hsbc uk account opened from India, you can try that
1/27/23, 15:35 - +44 7825 722378: i would recommend doing this
1/27/23, 15:38 - +44 7810 299673: I had the same issue. You can ask your employer for a Employment Verification Letter with Residential address on it. That worked for me.
1/27/23, 15:40 - +44 7440 737668: Thank you!!
1/27/23, 15:48 - +91 92786 17636: Easy would be opening a monzo account. They verify address by sending a pin. And then monzo statements can be used to open any other bank account
1/27/23, 15:50 - +91 97691 29871: Yeah I think with revolut they don't even send a pin across, can starting using immediately
1/27/23, 15:53 - +44 7440 737668: I tried that but my application got rejected right away and they didn't give a reason
1/27/23, 15:53 - +91 80101 55737: Does that account for the credit score?
1/27/23, 15:56 - +91 85277 00485: If you have a uk number use revolut
1/27/23, 16:01 - +44 7940 156531: Try Wise. That should open right away
1/27/23, 16:04 - +44 7442 325941: Use revolut untill you find a permanent accommodation. I’m doing the same and I received my first salary in my revolut account without any issues.
1/27/23, 16:12 - +91 97188 94580: If I am living in a Hostel, can I open a HSBC account by providing the revolut account statement as an address proof?
1/27/23, 16:13 - +91 97691 29871: Should work fine yes but give it a try.

1/27/23, 18:08 - +91 80101 55737: If they have booked the flights and accommodation both, it should match the time as well
1/27/23, 18:09 - +44 7429 214883: not sure how comfortable it would be. It's almost a full day. Finding a hotel and getting reimbursed by your company is probably the best option
1/27/23, 18:09 - +44 7704 930146: ask the company , I was also in a similar question and they where able to get me the apartment earlier #
1/27/23, 18:09 - +91 77740 86822: Your company should take care of that. Not you. Get back to them and tell the situation.
1/27/23, 18:10 - +91 80101 55737: This the right answer imo
1/27/23, 18:16 - +91 76800 49090: Was in a similar situation, your org should take care of it.
1/27/23, 19:03 - +44 7429 214883: Contact me if anyone is interested in subletting till 15th Feb?

1/28/23, 10:25 - +44 7895 629636: If your new employer sponsors visa and provides immigration services like fragomen, then they will handle everything. But process is same as what akash described. Fill the application, attend biometric, wait for new brp.

1/28/23, 12:31 - +91 72338 73365: Would you recommend any forex or credit card?
1/28/23, 12:34 - +44 7587 357657: Start out with Forex (i used to HDFC Multi currency). Once you have a proper UK account, you can go for a UK credit card.

In my experience, avoid using India credit card as you'll end up over paying on conversion fees.
1/28/23, 12:35 - +44 7741 569163: I opened Revolut UK account while being in India
1/28/23, 12:37 - +91 93043 48096: hi,

we recently moved to London. We are looking for flats but the agents are saying that it's extremely difficult to get a flat for less than 1 year contract (no break clause). And if we replace ourselves, we need to cover all the paperwork and background check costs (around 1500 £). Is this how it usually goes?
1/28/23, 12:38 - +91 80101 55737: £1500 😱😱😱😱
1/28/23, 12:38 - +44 7377 968999: You can look at spareroom for short lets
1/28/23, 12:38 - +91 72338 73365: I have ICICI multicurrecy forex card at the moment.
Would you recommend bringing forex of multiple banks?
1/28/23, 12:38 - +44 7377 968999: cityrooms.com
1/28/23, 12:38 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Are they flying to india to do the background check😂
1/28/23, 12:38 - +91 72338 73365: Will research about this
1/28/23, 12:39 - +44 7377 968999: Agents are definitely trying to take advantage of your lack of experience here
1/28/23, 12:39 - +91 80101 55737: I opened my HSBC account while I was in India. Check with your employer and relocation agency for this
1/28/23, 12:39 - +44 7587 357657: Nope, you're good to go with just 1
1/28/23, 12:39 - +91 98338 07887: The document charge generally is 50-75£ from what I've heard
1/28/23, 12:39 - +91 72338 73365: Will do. Thanks 🙏
1/28/23, 12:40 - +91 93043 48096: he said ki 90% of owners will not allow a break clause
1/28/23, 12:40 - +44 7377 968999: Jhoot bol Raha hai
1/28/23, 12:40 - +91 80101 55737: You need a new agent
1/28/23, 12:41 - +91 80101 55737: Is it employer provided relocation agent?
1/28/23, 12:41 - +44 7502 307298: I have a break clause 
Most of the ppl here have
He’s lying
1/28/23, 12:42 - +91 93043 48096: no this one we found on rightmove
1/28/23, 12:42 - +1 (226) 792-6466: i don't but my agent is shit so 🤷‍♂️
1/28/23, 12:42 - +91 93043 48096: got it
1/28/23, 12:43 - +91 93400 73117: What happens if there is a no break clause and you have to leave before the end of contract ?
1/28/23, 12:43 - +44 7377 968999: Check openrent, spareroom
1/28/23, 12:44 - +44 7377 968999: Pay penalty fees if landlord allows
1/28/23, 12:44 - +44 7377 968999: Or find a replacement tenant
1/28/23, 12:45 - +91 93400 73117: Agent is saying we’ll still need to pay them (1600£) for next contract background check and all
1/28/23, 12:45 - +91 80101 55737: Isn't this what break clause is? What I have been told that if you need to leave, you pay the whole rent for remaining months.
1/28/23, 12:45 - +44 7587 357657: Legally speaking, you'll have to pay up for the rest of the term. Practically speaking, you'll lose your deposit and feel the pressure to find a replacement depending on how long before the end of the term you decide to walk away
1/28/23, 12:45 - +91 80101 55737: Replacement is again a sort of break clause
1/28/23, 12:45 - +91 93400 73117: Yeah this is what the agent said
1/28/23, 12:45 - +44 7377 968999: Not really, break clause means you can give notice from that time to leave the property
1/28/23, 12:46 - +44 7377 968999: It seems like a whole lot of people here need to diversify their agents
1/28/23, 12:46 - +44 7587 357657: Break clause simply means lock-in. You can't terminate the agreement before lock-in has expired and therefore, you are deemed to have occupied the property for that long unless you have an agreement to the contrary with the landlord
1/28/23, 12:47 - +44 7587 357657: Hehe yes.. but dude, I've been there. There's only so much you can do with right move/zoopla.
1/28/23, 12:47 - +44 7377 968999: Explained in better terms 😂
1/28/23, 12:48 - +44 7587 357657: Lol, lawyer advantage 🙋🏻‍♂️
1/28/23, 12:49 - +44 7377 968999: Yeah, it's a full time job in itself
1/28/23, 12:50 - +44 7377 968999: You sort of end up knowing when you find the right agent or landlord though
1/28/23, 12:50 - +91 93400 73117: Thanks, and anyone recently rented a property and had a lock in period of less than a year ?
1/28/23, 12:50 - +91 93400 73117: All flats that we are seeing have a min contract of 1 year
1/28/23, 12:59 - +91 88618 97183: That's very rare to find and especially in this market where demand is super high.
1/28/23, 13:02 - +91 72338 73365: Did you buy UK sim card in India?
1/28/23, 13:04 - +44 7741 569163: No just got it from a local store
1/28/23, 13:04 - +44 7704 930146: U can get in the airport as well but a one time international pack should be enough
1/28/23, 13:06 - +44 7704 930146: If u are staying in a temporary accomodation given by ur company try asking the reception of these places
1/28/23, 13:06 - +44 7704 930146: They also have simcards
1/28/23, 13:31 - +91 77740 86822: Get a cheap lebara sim from hotukdeals. You can order one and get it delivered at any uk address.

Please contact my friend if are interested.

Dipra Jain -+44 7737784000
1/28/23, 14:32 - +91 99719 94016: Me and most of my friends also have 1 year contracts, I don't think you get less than that. But there is a provision of breaking the clause. I know someone who'd recently replaced themselves because they were moving out, the agency handled everything and they had to pay around 200 for inventory check and stuff, nothing else.
1/28/23, 14:38 - +91 99719 94016: Nope, you only need the forex for your initial days, just when you're setting up and don't have a bank account here. I'd gotten a HDFC forex from India and used it only for tube travelling, some shopping etc. then switched to Revolut here and been using that since. Revolut for day to day transactions and HSBC for salary deposit and bigger transactions
1/28/23, 14:38 - +91 99719 94016: Some people also use Chase, you get 1% cashback on every transaction.

Here's some more detailed information^
1/28/23, 15:37 - +44 7429 214883: Do you need a visa to travel to duba if you have brp and schengen visa?
1/28/23, 15:37 - +91 80101 55737: yes, but I think you'll be eligible for visa on arrival
1/28/23, 15:51 - +91 93043 48096: oh okay
1/28/23, 18:20 - +44 7895 629636: In which area do you guys live? When i was looking for flats in east (canary wharf, stratford etc), most flats had contracts of min 1 year without any break clause. They were willing to give 1 year break clause for 2 year contract.
1/28/23, 18:33 - +44 7502 307298: Canning town( close to Canary)
1/28/23, 19:59 - +91 72074 93066: Yes. We have signed a 1 year contract, but since we asked they have also added a break clause after 6 months, provided we inform the landlord 2 months in advance if we want to break before 1 year.
1/28/23, 20:01 - +91 88020 58589: Yes, we signed a 1 year contract for a flat near Canary Wharf with 6 month break clause.

1/29/23, 11:49 - +91 97188 94580: Hey,
To apply for schengen visa, I heard that we must have completed 3 months in the UK after getting our BRP card. Is it true?
1/29/23, 11:50 - +91 97110 90746: @919920431965 would disagree
1/29/23, 11:51 - +91 80101 55737: 3 months salary slip and bank statements are required generally.  I have heard of some exceptions though
1/29/23, 11:57 - +91 99204 31965: They had asked me to write on the cover letter that since I moved recently, I don't have 3 months statement. I got the visa 2 months' statement...This was for Spain

1/29/23, 13:59 - +91 88618 97183: Just want to check if they'll accept that or should I buy the Schengen insurance that's typically offered
1/29/23, 14:02 - +91 97178 23927: Yes that’s accepted

Found this for Schnegen in case anyone needs it. This is for Netherlands but I am sure most countries would have a similar checklist
1/29/23, 14:16 - +91 88618 97183: Has anyone applied for a visa via Netherlands Embassy. Have a question about something
1/29/23, 14:17 - +91 88618 97183: To apply for a Schengen visa in the United Kingdom go to the VFS Global application centre in Birmingham, Edinburgh, London or Manchester. You can only submit an application there if you live in the United Kingdom.

I have an appointment tomorrow. I think Netherlands gives an appointment before filling out the Application Form. Any idea where I canfill the application form. This is what I see on the website.

I do see this. Is this what we are supposed to fill ?
1/29/23, 16:06 - +91 99357 01111: Except Netherlands and France, which all countries give the option to book an appointment before filling out the actual application (without hotel, travel reservations, etc.)
1/29/23, 16:06 - +91 99357 01111: ?
1/29/23, 16:08 - +44 7424 832654: Any contacts of van services in west London ? For moving house ?

1/29/23, 16:12 - +44 7424 832654: Thanks
1/29/23, 16:30 - +91 88618 97183: Yep got this. For context, Netherlands Embassy has a visa application form
1/29/23, 16:41 - +44 7435 381245: Almost all, I think! You only need to produce the travel and flight tickets on the date of appointment. In terms of cheapest, I think it is Luxembourg, since it requires you to submit the application directly at the embassy (no third party is involved), but they require travel adn flights for seeking appointment as well. The appointment lead time is also long for them.
1/29/23, 16:57 - +91 88618 97183: Question: Do you need photocopy of only first page and last page of passport or all the pages?
1/29/23, 16:57 - +91 88618 97183: This days all which is why I'm now skeptical
1/29/23, 16:57 - +91 88618 97183: I'm at the Netherlands VFS just in case.

They sound a bit shady but they claim to get you the visa on time. 

Also, for Netherlands visa, can you change your appointment once you've booked it?
1/30/23, 12:01 - +91 88618 97183: You can provided there are slots. I tried doing it yesterday couldn't see any slots in the next two month period.
1/30/23, 12:02 - +91 74067 70011: Is there a limit to the number of times you can change it?

1/30/23, 14:16 - Anirudh Mittal: There are a lot of VISA agents that come up on googling. They seems reliable as they have 10k+ positive reviews on Google reviews. Their cost is a bit steep (150-300 pounds on top visa fee) so only worth it if you need an appointment urgently.  Latvia and Netherlands have express appointment service iirc which is under 100 pounds, but visa might not be long term.

They have the cheapest annual multi-travel quotes for Europe or worldwide
1/31/23, 23:58 - +44 7466 808228: Yes! You can book accomodation that has free cancelation and don't take any upfront cost while booking. Once you're done with your visa appointment, you can cancel the accomodation
2/1/23, 02:18 - +91 88618 97183: P.S. I've not done it and there are some tradeoffs from the various providers out there, but if you're looking only in terms of amount of money that reaches your Indian account,

https://exiap.co.uk/international-money-transfers/send-money-to-india

This is a good way to compare. It's totally dependent on the amount of money you send. If you send 1k Remitly could be cheaper, if you send 500 Wise could be cheaper.

2/2/23, 23:58 - +44 7385 957410: When a tenancy contract is ending, is the landlord/agend supposed to give us a notice acc to the standard notice period (2 months)  to vacate the place, or is it expected that we are supposed to vacate since the contract is ending?
2/2/23, 23:59 - +44 7436 038094: They will generally reach out to you to see your intention of what you want to do when the contract ends. Many agreements have a clause which says that it will be on a rolling basis after contract ends.
2/3/23, 00:01 - +44 7436 038094: The notice period is also specified in the agreement. It covers circumstances such as notice by tenant, notice by landlord, what happens in case the contract ends etc.
2/3/23, 08:42 - +44 7587 357657: The answer to your question is that technically speaking, the landlord has no obligation to give you notice if the contract is ending. He is free to use the property the way he deems fit after the contract is concluded (ie the term has expired). I've assumed there is no provision in the contract for automatic extensions.

Having said that, like others have rightly said - if they intend to continue to lease out the property, they are likely to have a conversation with you about the terms of extension as looking for a new tenant for the landlord will come with headaches at best and incurring costs for agents/brokers at worst.
2/3/23, 08:49 - +44 7880 119453: Unless specified otherwise in the contract, when the AST contract ends, it automatically goes into Rolling tenancy after the end of fixed period if you have not been served notice. The default notice period is 1 month from your side and 2 months from landlord.
Landlord is not free to use the property even after the fixed term ends.

2/3/23, 19:17 - +91 86748 07262: Has anyone tried zip car hire? I had few doubts. Do they require international driver permit? And how does the insurance work ? Whats the overall process like?
2/3/23, 20:24 - +91 77740 86822: One might be cabin, another might be checkin. Which airline is this
2/3/23, 20:33 - +91 81208 93207: If you want one extra bag of 23kg you choose - Piece Bag
2/3/23, 20:34 - +91 81208 93207: But if you want to increase some amount in your baggage you choose heavy piece bag, but I don’t know the exact Kgs included in that
2/3/23, 20:35 - +91 81208 93207: When I came to London I went for Piece bag it costed me around 12000₹ but I got an extra baggage allowance for 23kgs so that was a good deal as compared to the heavy piece bag.
2/3/23, 20:36 - +91 81208 93207: Cost of heavy piece bag is somewhere around 6000₹-7000₹ and I don’t think they allow a lot of weight in that .
2/3/23, 22:04 - +91 90133 32219: Yes, I have. No they didn't ask for IDP. Insurance is included in the rental. I would recommend it for small trips. For long trips, opt for something else as Zipcar doesn't have well maintained vehicles
2/3/23, 22:15 - +91 6269 565 555: Thank you for the input ❤️
2/3/23, 22:20 - +91 88618 97183: Virtuo is pretty good for long trips
2/3/23, 22:20 - +91 88618 97183: I did a 350 mile trip in December without problems
2/3/23, 22:28 - +44 7867 237365: If available, try turo. You directly deal with the car owner to rent it, so it's relatively inexpensive. When we rented a car, indian driving license was enough

2/4/23, 08:31 - +91 86748 07262: I.e. single day trips
2/4/23, 08:33 - +91 86748 07262: Last time i hired a car from airport for cotswold but it was too time consuming to go and pick a car on airport and then drop on airport again. Found that zip car is available near me so was thinking if i can hire it for a day teip
2/4/23, 08:34 - +91 90133 32219: No, within the city. Because you can hire a vehicle on an hourly basis from Zipcar and they also have some option to pick and drop at different places but I've never tried that
2/4/23, 08:35 - +91 86748 07262: Ohh gotcha, thanks will try turo or virtuo too 😀
2/4/23, 08:37 - +44 7405 506385: Yes
2/4/23, 08:40 - +44 7436 038094: Have used turo which gives you cars in your vicinity so it's easy to pick up. It's also insured for the time you have hired. Good to check how many miles the car offers for free and accordingly can plan the distance you want to cover. For age under 25 drivers, they charge an extra fee. You need to upload your licence copy a day or two in advance so they approve the documentation before you can hire it
2/4/23, 09:33 - +91 72338 73365: Moving to UK in march. 
Would you recommend getting a UK sim in India or at the airport in London?
2/4/23, 09:34 - +91 94549 32137: get one from the vfs office, they give it for free
2/4/23, 09:35 - +91 72338 73365: Which carrier would you recommend?

2/4/23, 09:46 - +91 90047 09360: You can probably bring some food items to get you started with for the first month or so.

A good place to start would be:
1. All dals (1kg)
2. All usual spices, haldi, cardamom, garam masala etc.
3. 1kg aata, rice, sooji
4. Tamarind or tamarind powder (if you eat Sambhar or some food items that needs it)
5. Rock salt (usually needed for fasting)
6. Pav Bhaji, Sambhar Masala, Hakka Noodles masala, etc.
7. Tea, coffee etc. Hard to find wagh bakri in London
8. Snacking items like Haldiram bhujia, namkeens etc. 

You can usually get almost everything in London, from certain areas like Kingsbury, Wembley, Eastham, Southall etc.

Sometimes you might have to compromise on either price or quality of the items as most things will seem 2-3 times expensive when you first arrive. 

I've got an extensive list of items here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kjy8vzSJM1ZIMo2N1kQRhtwT1K31XkuHEE2DAJPbAMY/edit?usp=drivesdk
2/4/23, 10:11 - +44 7379 166516: Maggi masala 🫠

2/4/23, 10:22 - +91 97164 84696: Getting theplas is a convenient option for initial days.
2/4/23, 11:01 - +91 98990 08719: 1. Homemade pickle
2. your fav homemade/store-bought snacks (if they are not a common household snack in India)

PS: Almost everything is easily available here so no need to stress a lot about this part 😁
2/4/23, 11:03 - +44 7385 372267: Haldiram Aloo Bhujia
2/4/23, 11:13 - +44 7867 056289: I think drugs aren't allowed on flights 😂

1. Anything that’s battery powered should go in your cabin luggage.
2. Anything that’s sharp, scissors, allen keys, etc should go in your check-in luggage.

For general items, it doesn’t really matter.

Better to put all batteries in hand luggage and sharp items in check in
2/5/23, 19:35 - +91 96030 24199: Yes, I had to tell that that I attempted auto debit from current account but that didn't work so refunded the charges and fixed the auto debit as well.

2/6/23, 08:36 - +44 7741 569163: Hi,

I have this lovely ensuite double room up for grabs in our house,

TL: DR:  ensuite double room, friendly housemate, duplex layout, balcony with a view of shard and tower bridge.

The house is a duplex with a bright living room and kitchen on one floor, and 2 ensuite rooms on another floor. The living room has a balcony attached with views of the Shard and Tower bridge. The living room has a huge TV, sofa, and dining table. The kitchen is equipped with all amenities (dishwasher, microwave, grill, oven, fridge, freezer, washing machine). The room itself is an ensuite double bedroom with a huge sliding full mirrored closet. It also comes with a table and a side bed table. The bathroom again has a huge mirror with a bathtub. You will be sharing the flat with my existing flatmate, who occupies the other room. He is a chill out friendly guy who works in strategy consulting.

The Council Tax band is band F and bills will be approximately £250-£300 each month (less in the summer).

We are looking for a friendly, sociable, working professional. The flat is in a gated apartment and its so peaceful here at night.

That's everything but if you have any questions please let me know.

K:)

2/6/23, 08:46 - +44 7895 629636: Belgium slots are usually available as well.
2/6/23, 09:01 - +91 88630 30999: Has anyone applied through Germany recently? What's the waiting time there for appointment slots?
2/6/23, 09:46 - +44 7974 630857: Greece. Got it for the next day after having issues with France visa appointment.
2/6/23, 09:50 - +91 99294 55503: I am planning to apply for my parents visa but i read one guideline that you can apply a maximum 3 months before the travel date. So the application can't be submitted before 3 months or you can't have a biometric appointment before 3 months?
2/6/23, 09:53 - +44 7436 038094: Your application is submitted at the appointment itself. So believe that date needs to be within 3 months bracket
2/6/23, 09:54 - +44 7436 038094: You will get a visa for 6 months, so even if you apply a for a date bit earlier and your parents want travel in say the 4th month, the visa will still be valid
2/6/23, 10:04 - +91 96555 46091: Hey all, for driving in Scotland/the UK, is an International Driving permit mandatory along with the Indian license? The official uk gov website says we can drive with just an Indian license for an year, but wanted to confirm if there's no catch.
2/6/23, 10:07 - +44 7436 038094: No your usual Indian licence works here
2/6/23, 10:07 - +44 7436 038094: For a year
2/6/23, 10:08 - +91 86748 07262: I had issue with avis so wont recommend booking though avis. At last booked my car through enterprise and they were ok without any permit
2/6/23, 10:09 - +91 96555 46091: Okay thanks, I'll remember to check with the rental beforehand.
2/6/23, 10:15 - +91 99294 55503: So does that mean I can simply put a travel date which is 3 months from now but in actuality my parents will travel in the 4th month?
2/6/23, 10:17 - +91 99294 55503: The only concern I have is if we submit an application 3 months prior and it takes 1.5 months to get the visa then we will book tickets 1.5 months prior to travel dates so tickets might be costly
2/6/23, 10:18 - +44 7436 038094: Yeah you can do that. They don't look for actual tickets anyway. They only look for funds in your accounts to see affordability of buying that ticket.
2/6/23, 10:18 - +44 7436 038094: This is only for UK visa. A Schengen will ask for travel booking details too

2/6/23, 10:18 - +91 99294 55503: Ok got it. Thanks
2/6/23, 10:19 - +44 7436 038094: Yes safe side can book refundable tickets if you want
2/6/23, 10:19 - +91 99294 55503: Hmm
2/6/23, 10:20 - +91 99294 55503: Have you heard of any rejection in parents visitor visa?
2/6/23, 10:21 - +44 7436 038094: Yes heard of a case where someone applied for parents visa saying they will stay for full 6 months and dint submit enough proof of funds etc. So you can say they are traveling for a few weeks , show funds against it and the visa will anyway come of 6 months.
2/6/23, 10:22 - +91 99294 55503: Ohk
2/6/23, 10:35 - +44 7741 569163: Update: the flat is now gone…
2/6/23, 10:39 - +44 7594 775011: France also

2/6/23, 10:52 - +44 7940 156531: https://www.footballticketnet.com/

Check here. If you go through the right processes you need a membership yes. But if you wanna avoid that you can just go through this and you'll get the ticket. At the turnstiles nobody checks the name on the ticket so you're good

2/6/23, 16:44 - +44 7551 082770: Nothing else is needed. They might ask you why you live in UK, that’s all
2/6/23, 16:50 - +44 7867 099227: No proof of work is required?
2/6/23, 16:51 - +44 7551 082770: Haven’t asked me yet (re-entered a few times)

I'm traveling via Air India and booked the tickets through Sky Scanner which seemed to have this bug.
2/7/23, 08:08 - +91 77740 86822: Call the airline and get it rectified. Shouldn't be a problem though
2/7/23, 08:11 - +44 7867 099227: No problem, same issue w me travelled twice without any hassle
2/7/23, 08:58 - +91 90047 09360: I called up Air India and they asked me to get in touch with the city office. Will do that today just to be safe but as Yash mentioned, most people do not report any hassle because of that no-space thing.

2/8/23, 10:11 - +44 7379 166516: call them up because even google doesn’t show accurate timing
2/8/23, 10:13 - +44 7895 629636: On one hand you get 40% tax savings which is significant. On the other hand, money is blocked till you are 55/57. So more of a personal choice. It is very easy and free of cost to transfer pension to India when you leave uk if that is a concern.
2/8/23, 10:15 - +44 7880 019156: Will it be taxed in India if I transfer it?
2/8/23, 10:16 - +44 7895 629636: Not when you transfer it, but when you withdraw it as an annuity after 55, then the annuity is added to your total taxable income.
2/8/23, 10:17 - +91 90047 09360: My company's plan is transferrable to some compatible plans back in India. 

They also seem to match my contributions, so it's like extra money over and above my package. 

You would need to purchase annuity i.e. monthly/quarterly pension, which would then be taxed as income. I'm not sure whether we can get a lumpsum out of it.
2/8/23, 10:22 - +44 7895 629636: If you keep it in uk until 55, then 25% lumpsum is tax free. You can take annuity using uk plans too
2/8/23, 10:29 - +44 7880 019156: I see

I have an upcoming appointment at vfs for italy schengen visa. I was booking flights and saw that all flights have either a stop at brussles or frankfurt. My question is do I need to apply for a airport transit visa as well to apply for schengen visa? Has anyone traveled to ital via these airports? Do you guys had a transit visa?
2/12/23, 10:21 - +44 7385 372267: Schengen covers all of them. You don't have to worry.
2/12/23, 10:23 - +91 94552 22973: I reqd online that even if i hold a schengen visa I might need a airport transit visa
2/12/23, 10:27 - +44 7385 372267: I think it's part of Schengen area
2/12/23, 10:30 - +44 7776 679589: Not for Brussels or Frankfurt.

2/12/23, 14:45 - +91 86024 45109: How can I keep my jio sim active in London just for OTPs?
2/12/23, 14:48 - +44 7405 367004: Highgate residents here or Tufnell park?
2/12/23, 14:56 - +91 96015 27199: +1 for Vodafone idea
2/12/23, 14:59 - +91 90047 09360: You probably just need balance in the sim and recharge it once in 3 months with the bare minimum ISD plan. 

I've been doing that since the past 7-8 months. Vi works fine on the Vodafone network in UK
2/12/23, 15:03 - +91 80101 55737: Sunday ko oxford st kab tak khula rehta hai?
2/12/23, 15:03 - +91 80101 55737: I mean shops and restaurants
2/12/23, 15:05 - +91 90047 09360: Google has timings for particular shops but 6PM would be my calculated guess.

9-10PM for most restaurants though
2/12/23, 15:05 - +91 95478 29283: U need to turn on international roaming before leavong india and pay a monthly top up cost. Around 200 ish i gs
2/12/23, 15:05 - +91 95478 29283: Most shops close by 5 - 6 pm on sundays
2/12/23, 15:09 - +91 96015 27199: I have postpaid . hopefully this stays the same for that as well
2/12/23, 15:26 - +44 7855 984156: Are you sure we need ISD plan for Jio? Any normal active plan with international roaming suffices for my Airtel
2/12/23, 15:27 - +91 90047 09360: My suggestion was for Vi. I don't really need a particular plan for Vi, just some balance and an annual plan works fine for keeping the SMS working.
2/12/23, 15:27 - +91 90047 09360: Vi doesn't even need ISD roaming plans. Just validity.
2/12/23, 15:28 - +91 90047 09360: For some reason I couldn't get my Jio to work in London. Anyone has other suggestions?
2/12/23, 15:28 - +44 7855 984156: International roaming activated on number actually with any active plan

2/13/23, 14:43 - +91 80101 55737: I read on multiple websites, only tourist visa holders qualifies for visa free requirement. BRP holders do need a separate visa.
2/13/23, 14:44 - Anirudh Mittal: Got it, thanks.
Any estimate on the average processing time?
2/13/23, 14:57 - +44 7776 679589: Three weeks. Also. Heads up. The VFS here are really bad. They sent me someone else’s passport through the courier after processing. So if they ask, say you’ll come and collect it yourself when it’s ready.
2/13/23, 14:59 - +44 7459 511980: Did you get a waiver on the visa fee? I read somewhere that they waive the fee for BRP holders
2/13/23, 15:00 - +91 80101 55737: This is horrible!
2/13/23, 15:05 - +44 7776 679589: Yea but it’s not free. You still have to pay around 40-60 GBP. Forgot what the exact amount was sorry. It’s just reduced.

2/15/23, 01:54 - +91 98999 90708: Hey,

Can a BRP holder go to Dubai without applying for a visa?
2/15/23, 03:15 - +91 96015 27199: I have been hearing these horrible stories that how medical system is so bad in UK. I will be joining Google London, doesn't the company provide us with a medical insurance which is different from the free UK one? If not what i can prepare from India before moving to London? I have dust allergies and some other stuff which i am prone to hence worried.
2/15/23, 03:29 - +44 7429 214883: Yeah they do provide private insurance
2/15/23, 03:29 - +44 7429 214883: On arrival visa is available for brp holders
2/15/23, 03:32 - +91 96015 27199: Is it as good as we get in India? Free doctor's consultation and prescribed medication as well?
2/15/23, 04:03 - +44 7429 214883: Idk about medicines but consultation and tests are covered
2/15/23, 07:04 - +91 87774 05725: You will get visa on arrival at the airport
2/15/23, 08:05 - +27 81 475 4314: Medicines are not covered.
You will generally get a consultation on a video/audio call. If they feel you are really in a bad shape they might let you visit or send you to emergency ward .
2/15/23, 08:15 - +44 7440 197856: Bring your set of medicines in check in bag and have local doctors prescription safe side. 

All the private medical will only provide you easy access to virtual appointments, it’s very hard to convince them that you’ve serious problems. For eg: in case of abdomen pain, they’ll not give antibiotics however you plead! So getting antibiotics will be pain if you’re in need of one! They believe in nature healing no matter people suffer😂
2/15/23, 10:24 - +91 87623 99909: Thanks. I could also book in London today. Guess they release appointments on 15th and 30th of each month.
2/15/23, 10:25 - +44 7405 556580: Which dates appointments you got?
2/15/23, 10:26 - +91 87623 99909: Appointments are available from 6th March. This is for Iceland. Which country did you book for?

2/15/23, 12:56 - +44 7440 197856: So I had to return without allowing me to submit docs today. So to others who are yet to go to your appointment, do ensure this!
2/15/23, 12:57 - +44 7940 156531: Think the rule is you should apply from the first country you'll enter or the country where you'll spend the most time
2/15/23, 12:58 - +91 98115 73710: Which embassy was this?
2/15/23, 12:58 - +91 80101 55737: I think it's mandatory. They have mentioned on the websites. I've heard people being asked to apply from other embassy for the same reason
2/15/23, 12:58 - +91 80101 55737: Nope.
Longest stay has highest preference
2/15/23, 12:59 - +44 7435 381245: +1
2/15/23, 12:59 - +44 7940 156531: Depends on your luck. I've applied twice to places I've entered first and shown I'll stay elsewhere for a longer time and didn't have any problems
2/15/23, 13:00 - +44 7440 197856: So I applied for entry point of country but stay was less
2/15/23, 13:00 - +44 7440 197856: Hungary
2/15/23, 13:00 - +44 7940 156531: Which country?
2/15/23, 13:01 - +44 7940 156531: Hmm have heard they're a bit strict
2/15/23, 13:01 - +44 7440 197856: Vfs screwed it . I tried removing everything and said okay I’ll apply only for that country but vfs team was very rigid! Not at all helpful
2/15/23, 13:04 - +91 87774 05725: Yes
2/15/23, 13:06 - +44 7940 156531: Always better off applying at bigger countries. They're quicker too in my experience
2/15/23, 13:08 - +44 7440 197856: Found this one being available around Early Jan so booked it😓

2/16/23, 07:44 - +91 88618 97183: Just first and last.
2/16/23, 07:44 - +91 88618 97183: All other pages were empty except British visa
2/16/23, 07:44 - +91 88618 97183: Does that make a difference
2/16/23, 07:45 - +44 7448 200493: Not for duration, if it was a requirement they would have rejected outright.
2/16/23, 07:46 - +44 7448 200493: I asked cause the doc checklist on their site says all pages for some reason and I have an appointment for same

2/16/23, 09:33 - +91 96015 27199: If not, please let me know anything else related to sending money to india that needs to be done before I leave india
2/16/23, 09:35 - +91 97939 85367: According to rules set by Indian banking - Yes. You should send amount only to NRE accounts.

But practically, I believe you can send amount from here to any bank account in India. NRE/NRO is not compulsory.
2/16/23, 09:36 - +91 97939 85367: Would suggest you to take your BRP (soft copy that you would have received) passport, PAN and aadhar card to any bank and open an NRE account while you are in India.
2/16/23, 09:46 - +91 88618 97183: But will they have any taxation on it if we do that?
2/16/23, 10:11 - +91 78792 79478: I think by rules it's for self
You can anyways send money to parents Indian account, Remitly even allows to send to any UPI VPA

2/19/23, 10:36 - +91 86748 07262: Hey Guys, Any recommendations for Atta. I previously used to order AAshirvad Aata from WGGrocer.com but now its not available there. I am looking for multigrain flour. Any comparable Atta that I can get from Asda, tesco or Sainsbury? Or any other Indian store from where I can get AAshirvad Aata?
2/19/23, 10:46 - +44 7443 976019: <Media omitted>

2/19/23, 11:30 - +91 88275 24158: Export banned or import? If UK banned it then the reason could be adulteration in atta
2/19/23, 11:34 - +91 96015 27199: And if we pack it in our luggage while coming to UK will that be a problem? I am traveling for the first time and hearing rumours that white powdered substance (sugar, atta) are banned in UK customs
2/19/23, 11:37 - +91 98738 55921: I think, if it is open it is a problem. You can keep it in your luggage and not in cabin bag. It won't be a problem.

2/21/23, 09:30 - +91 97691 29871: It will as long as you have international transactions enabled. Would also be a good idea to get a Forex card though.

2/21/23, 12:45 - +91 98738 55921: If you have a govt bank account, and it has international debit option, you will pay less in currency conversion and use it for all offline and online transactions. It will be cheaper for you than Forex or any private Indian bank. Additionally, if you have brp, Indian passport but international residence details, you can try opening a revolut account.

2/21/23, 22:00 - +91 97939 85367: Nearest pub.
2/21/23, 22:01 - +91 97939 85367: Or BT sport, NowTV, Amazon Prime, Viaplay
2/21/23, 22:02 - +44 7436 952806: Guys go to crichd u will get to watch match free
2/21/23, 22:03 - +91 94286 61452: Amazon Prime in the UK is not streaming the matches(except few PL matches). They stream UCL home matches in Germany and Italy
2/21/23, 22:08 - +91 97939 85367: You can buy LaligaTV channel on Prime and watch Laliga matches there. They also have acquired UCL rights in UK from next or next-to-next year.

UK me legally football dekhna kaafi mehenga hai 😕
2/21/23, 22:09 - +91 94286 61452: Yes. Laliga or Premier Sports subscription
2/21/23, 22:11 - +91 94286 61452: btw for UCL matches there is a hack I follow.
livescore.com shows the UCL matches for free in Ireland. I connect Amazon's Dublin VPN server and watch the match there 😅😛

2/22/23, 08:54 - +91 87686 68885: I used FlightGen app screenshot which generates fake itinerary in my last appointment from Netherlands and got the visa
2/22/23, 08:54 - +44 7385 530132: Wow nice

2/22/23, 09:07 - +44 7940 156531: Yes tried both, they both refunded within 3 days of cancellation
2/22/23, 09:22 - Abizer Lokhandwala Meta UK: People who had Groww/Zerodha accounts before making the move to London, did things work smoothly with the apps once you changed your linked bank account from resident to NRO?
2/22/23, 09:24 - +44 7776 651349: I actually closed my resident demat and created nro non pis zerodha account
2/22/23, 09:24 - +91 96389 52451: Don't they have more brokerage and resident ones?
2/22/23, 09:25 - +44 7776 651349: Its not thaaat much more
Only con is you cant trade FnO
2/22/23, 09:25 - +91 97691 29871: They do but legally you need to change it to that. Never been an issue even if you don't as long as your income tax returns are fine.
2/22/23, 09:27 - +91 96389 52451: Yeah that's what a CA told me
2/22/23, 09:27 - +91 86748 07262: Is it required to show swiss pass when applying visa for switzerland? As for my accomodation proofs i am showing multiple swiss cities but dont have proof of travelling between cities in switzerland?
2/22/23, 09:29 - Abizer Lokhandwala Meta UK: Makes sense. Unfortunately groww has no option for linking with nro accounts. Wanted to know if there is any other option apart from liquidating all assets
2/22/23, 09:30 - +44 7776 651349: So why not open a parallel nro zerodha account and slowly move assets there from groww, if you plan to stay here for long it'll be better from legal perspective
2/22/23, 09:34 - Abizer Lokhandwala Meta UK: In case nothing else works out with Groww, that might be the only option

2/24/23, 10:32 - +91 97691 29871: Same bank will close the credit card. But other banks you can always continue.
2/24/23, 10:41 - +44 7895 629636: Better to open nro account with a separate bank, else the current bank will close your credit card.
2/24/23, 10:50 - +44 7385 947429: Any idea about icici and HDFC?
2/24/23, 11:46 - +44 7776 651349: You can link that credit card to new nro account
2/24/23, 12:08 - +44 7895 629636: This is not allowed, bank will close your credit card. NRI are not allowed to have indian credit cards as per bank rules.

2/24/23, 12:09 - +91 93400 73117: yeah if you do an FD with them, they can give you a credit card against that. But you cannot have a credit card like your regular indian account once it's converted to NRO.
2/24/23, 12:11 - +91 93400 73117: Amazon Pay credit card is different, you don't need to open an account with ICICI to get one. So that and Amex etc will continue to work
2/24/23, 12:19 - +91 96015 27199: Can we have a credit card from diff Bank while having nri account from diff Bank?

The accommodation is non refundable and non reschedulable.

Face value: 293 GBP

Let me know if anyone is interested and willing to go for a lower price as 150 GBP (30 GBP per Guest).!

3/5/23, 22:40 - +44 7880 039057: Try to take priority services like booking the appointment because it takes 1 - 3 weeks to process and then a few weeks to deliver which is a bit variable.

I booked Business Premier tickets via trainline for eurostar train and had to cancel due to change of plans. Its been a month and I have not received the amount. Amount is pretty big (1k pounds), so was wondering if we can TAKE ANY STRICT ACTIONS against either Trainline or Eurostar, or is there any portal where we can compaint agains these ? 
It would be really helpful if you can provide any pointers on how can I get it sorted 😅
3/6/23, 12:12 - +91 88618 97183: I've got it within 7 days. This ideally shouldn't happen. Maybe emailing them might help?

3/6/23, 12:14 - +91 86748 07262: Tried it. Trainline is a mess, they say its pending on eurostars end and once they refund it trainline will initiate the refund. But since its been a month, I am loosing hope 🥹
3/6/23, 12:15 - +91 88618 97183: Ah okay. I had booked directly on the Eurostar app. So not sure in that case.

3/6/23, 12:31 - +91 97188 94580: Any idea how much time this process is gonna take as I am flying in 1st week of next month?
3/6/23, 12:32 - +44 7824 343230: You need to book a transit visa appointment with the Embassy and see..
3/6/23, 12:33 - +44 7831 426623: If you have a canadian/us visa i dont think you need a transit
3/6/23, 12:34 - +91 80101 55737: Website says you don't need a transit visa if you have US or Canada visa

3/6/23, 12:34 - +91 80101 55737: Thanks for confirmation

3/6/23, 13:03 - +91 80101 55737: Hello guys,
My friend and I are planning to visit belgium(Brussels and brugges) over the 25th-26th March weekend.  If anyone wishes to join us let us know!
3/6/23, 13:07 - +91 89713 88222: No
3/6/23, 13:14 - +44 7366 440809: I am not able to find visa appointments for sweden/france/italy/portugal/greece 😭😭 what to doooo
3/6/23, 13:15 - +91 94286 61452: W84it
3/6/23, 14:10 - +91 88618 97183: Wait for 15tg of the month.
3/6/23, 14:11 - +44 7404 280342: Is 1 hr layover enough at abu dhabi airport ? Economy , no proority checkin.
3/6/23, 14:11 - +44 7776 849517: Best shot is to go for an agent.
3/6/23, 14:21 - +91 98738 55921: Eurostar is pretty quick in refunds. I once was delayed by an hour by Eurostar. They refunded me half of the amount of my ticket.
3/6/23, 14:21 - +44 7867 099227: What’s the avg wait time w an agent? And how much do they usually charge?
3/6/23, 14:23 - +44 7776 849517: You would get appointment for early April onward if you try now, charge is usually around £350 but that’s inclusive of Visa fees and all other costs.
3/6/23, 14:24 - +91 80101 55737: 😱😱😱
Bro ye to meri puri paris trip ka budget tha, including visa and courier
3/6/23, 14:26 - +44 7776 849517: I understand but I have been trying for more than a month to get visa slot for Spain and Germany but it didn’t work out for me.
3/6/23, 14:37 - +44 7443 077947: thanks bhai can you get me in touch with the agent ?
3/6/23, 14:41 - +44 7903 678132: Don't agents buy all the slots beforehand and then sell them for like 200 pounds?
3/6/23, 14:44 - +91 98738 55921: Bloody agents! We should report it.
3/6/23, 14:45 - +44 7776 849517: That’s the game :)
3/6/23, 14:45 - +44 7776 849517: Sure, I’ll DM you the details
3/6/23, 14:51 - +44 7903 678132: Did u not try applying through some other country like Norway? They will open their slots mid-march. Too much waste to pay 300 pounds for a 25 pounds slot
3/6/23, 14:53 - +44 7903 678132: I managed to book Norway's slots in September 2022. Not sure what's the situation now
3/6/23, 14:54 - +44 7903 678132: A friend of mine has a telegram bot to get notified for visa slots. It has support for Portugal, Netherlands and Italy. As soon as the slots are available, you are notified. https://t.me/schengen_slot_bot
3/6/23, 14:55 - +44 7903 678132: This is a telegram bot which notifies u when there are empty slots available. It does charge u like maybe 5 or 6 pounds but still better than paying 300 pounds to an agent 😬

3/6/23, 15:08 - +91 96168 84305: Yep it is super useful
3/6/23, 15:08 - +91 96168 84305: I was finally able to get an appointment despite VFS being shit over past few days.

"In all cases, there is no tax to pay when RSUs are granted. You only pay tax on RSUs when they vest. The UK tax treatment for RSUs is similar to how your salary is taxed. When your RSUs vest, you will pay income tax and employee national insurance. You may also need to pay for employers national insurance. Employers have the discretion to either pay this themself or transfer the liability to you."

3/7/23, 17:48 - +91 90047 09360: They check it for hand baggage if you're carrying a lot. I've carried 30-60 tablets in check in baggage without prescription. They might stop if you have like 200s of tablets. A good idea is to spread out in your bag.
3/7/23, 17:49 - +44 7379 166516: I have carried ayurvedic medicines with prescription, like 200 tabs in check in luggage! No questions asked!

3/7/23, 19:36 - +44 7708 288062: is 1 hour layover in Dubai enough for a flight from india to london?
For emirates
3/7/23, 19:42 - +44 7983 735999: depends. could be risky. delayed flights, changing terminals or gates, confirm if they'll switch the luggages themselves if not then you've to claim the baggage and check in again.
3/7/23, 19:42 - +44 7983 735999: still 1hr is less
3/7/23, 19:43 - +44 7708 288062: they said they’ll transfer the luggage themselves
3/7/23, 19:43 - +91 86978 18442: I think Emirates should be able to help you with that because it's the airline's responsibility to make sure they board you if it's the same PNR
3/7/23, 19:43 - +91 90512 86931: Immigration takes time sometimes. Even depends on which time you will be on dubai airport!
3/7/23, 19:44 - +44 7708 288062: they said there’s no immigration at dubai, only security
3/7/23, 19:44 - +44 7983 735999: security might take time too
3/7/23, 19:44 - +91 90512 86931: If only security, then it will be okay I guess.
3/7/23, 19:45 - +44 7708 288062: cool thanks
3/7/23, 19:45 - +44 7708 288062: yeah it is the same PNR. hopefully it will be fine
3/7/23, 19:45 - +44 7977 293625: If same airline, then it’s generally okay because they prioritise such passengers
3/7/23, 19:46 - +44 7983 735999: confirm with them if they'll rebook a flight in case you miss it. if you have to pay extra and how much. 1hr should be fine if it's the same airlines but still, doesn't hurt to be informed
3/7/23, 20:36 - +91 89713 88222: Any suggestions on taking a rental car with an Indian license
3/7/23, 20:52 - +91 88618 97183: Virtuo and Turo both work. I came in October 2022 still using my Indian license.
3/7/23, 20:53 - +91 88618 97183: Other apps have reviews where they say car rental companies cut your deposit unnecessarily. I have not tried it myself but apparently it happens.
3/7/23, 21:35 - +91 97180 83994: When does Turo deduct the deposit?
3/7/23, 22:10 - +44 7879 996571: Anybody looking to sell holi party tickets for Saturday?
3/7/23, 22:11 - +44 7385 530132: I’m also interested in the tickets for Holi Party.
3/7/23, 22:12 - +91 88618 97183: When as in for damages or for the initial deduction?
3/7/23, 22:15 - +91 97180 83994: The initial deduction
3/7/23, 22:15 - +91 88618 97183: When you book the car.
3/7/23, 22:15 - +91 88618 97183: From what I can see on my statement.
3/7/23, 22:15 - +91 88618 97183: My first ride on Turo is next month so take my advice with a pinch of salt for Turob
3/7/23, 22:16 - +91 88618 97183: Virtuo I've used several times
3/7/23, 22:19 - +44 7867 237365: I've tried turo before. The initial deduction happens before you rent the car. Would suggest going for the best insurance option they have. Other than that, the overall experience depends on the person you are renting the car from. In our case, the owner didn't bother about the kms covered even though the listing had a limit
3/7/23, 22:19 - +44 7867 237365: I used indian driving license
3/7/23, 22:21 - +91 97180 83994: Niceee

3/7/23, 23:34 - +44 7465 038006: Even I had 1 hour layover. India to Dubai jet airways then and Dubai to London Emirates. Airlines handled luggage. My responsibility was only security check at Dubai. Even I was worried while booking and before travel but I had no problems and 1 hour was more than enough. Just bare in mind Dubai airport is huge so try not to waste time and be a little quick to reach the boarding gates.

3/8/23, 14:54 - +91 98738 55921: Hey guys, for NHS, do you know if we get free medicines if we have NHS prescription?
3/8/23, 14:57 - +44 7466 808228: No the meds aren't free unless you belong to the exempt category, usually the prescription charges are £9.35 per item
3/8/23, 14:59 - +91 98738 55921: What the hell! It is so expensive. 🥹🥹🥹🥹 This is a different way of making money
3/8/23, 15:00 - +44 7466 808228: Haha they're still cheaper than private, through NHS prescription atleast the meds are capped at £9.35
3/8/23, 15:03 - +91 98738 55921: each item is 9.35, it is bit too much, in France they are free.
3/8/23, 15:03 - +91 98738 55921: so I am confused why UK is so expensive and health facilities are so expensive.
3/8/23, 15:04 - +91 88275 24158: Aesthetic hai
3/8/23, 15:05 - +91 97691 29871: each prescription is 9.35, multiple meds in a prescription are covered I think.
3/8/23, 15:05 - +91 87268 14391: +1
3/8/23, 15:06 - +91 87268 14391: Each medicine isn't 9
3/8/23, 15:08 - +44 7551 082770: No they aren’t. Each medicine in prescription costs you 9.35
3/8/23, 15:09 - +44 7741 569163: Simple solution: don’t get sick.
3/8/23, 15:10 - +91 98738 55921: there is more than just falling sick, one may need medication to.
3/8/23, 15:11 - +44 7466 808228: Not sure what the charges are for repeat prescriptions, best to check with any pharmacy!
3/8/23, 15:13 - +91 97178 23927: why are we paying thousands of ££ in the name of NI then🥲
3/8/23, 15:14 - +91 97110 90746: Its for British people to get nhs
3/8/23, 15:15 - +91 98738 55921: What? We do as well?

3/8/23, 15:20 - +44 7392 396109: Anyone on long term visas (innovator or global talent) have to pay NHS health surcharge of £625 per year. For instance, if you're applying for a 5-year visa, you gotta pay 625x5 when applying. 🥲

next time i will need to specify ‘/s’
3/8/23, 15:25 - +91 95035 16229: If it is a repeat prescription for a chronic condition, you might be eligible for medical exemption, which means your prescriptions are free
3/8/23, 15:28 - +91 98738 55921: It is really sad though.
3/8/23, 15:44 - +44 7438 321212: Yes true
3/8/23, 15:56 - +91 90047 09360: I've heard British folks actually say this when I asked them how they manage to get appointments with doctors.
3/8/23, 15:58 - +44 7438 321212: They all have NHS GP and a private GP just in case they don't get the NHS appointment on time, which is (always)
3/8/23, 16:08 - +44 7551 082770: Again not true, you have to have either certain conditions which can give you a Medex certificate. Or you can use PPC which gives some discount if you have a repeat prescription

3/8/23, 16:48 - +91 80048 73023: Only sleet here in Stratford !!

3/8/23, 17:53 - +91 98738 55921: Raining in west London too.
3/8/23, 18:03 - +91 97178 23927: Snowing off/on in Colindale since morning
3/8/23, 19:06 - +91 88053 44006: What makes it say so?
3/8/23, 19:22 - +91 98738 55921: I have heard people saying. Perhaps due to lack of workforce.
3/8/23, 19:29 - +91 88053 44006: It may be issue to some extent in periphery but not in London mostly. NHS has very high standards of care and service provision.

3/9/23, 12:54 - +44 7436 038094: They will not be able to visit for than 6 months in one go
3/9/23, 12:54 - +44 7466 617323: Yea that’s correct. But they can choose to apply for 5yrs visitor visa instead of applying every year with a limit of 180days on any visit

3/9/23, 16:06 - +44 7385 372267: Might be an issue because of Indian credit cards as they have a different 2FA mechanism.
3/9/23, 16:16 - +91 97939 85367: Yes I got this error when I tried with HDFC diners black card, but on trying with a different card, the issue was resolved. 

Just doubly check with your friend whether they have provided all the necessary permissions (limits) on the card usage.
3/9/23, 16:18 - Keshav IITB 20 UK: Okay thank you.. will try these suggestions
3/9/23, 16:30 - Abizer Lokhandwala Meta UK: You need to enable international payments with diners black, and wait for a few hours for it to sync. That worked for me.
3/9/23, 16:56 - +44 7767 977960: Did anyone had issues with applying for credit cards? All of my applications are getting rejected because the can't really 'trace' me

3/9/23, 17:05 - +27 81 475 4314: We got it several time recently.  Tried using a indian credit card and then it worked.
3/9/23, 17:06 - +44 7767 977960: could you elaborate please? I've been here 6 months already, not sure what you mean by building credit
3/9/23, 17:09 - +91 97110 90746: Seems weird, I applied for Amex and got it in my 2nd month in UK
3/9/23, 17:09 - +91 97178 23927: some suggestions to build better credit if not done already : register on electoral list, ensure your name is present on council tax bill, get a basic CC from your bank build credit history for 3+ months and then apply to other card companies
3/9/23, 17:11 - +44 7767 977960: Makes sense, thank you!

3/9/23, 18:08 - +91 98694 00392: Any specific credit card you suggest that has a good payback scheme?
3/9/23, 18:08 - +91 97691 29871: The chase debit card is decent for year 1 as well
3/9/23, 18:11 - +91 97178 23927: I am using Amex, it converts Amex points to Avois points which can be redeemed on Avios partners - https://www.avios.com/gb/en/spend
3/9/23, 18:12 - +91 98694 00392: Accha. I got the Amex good card which has a decent rewards system. Wanted to check if there are anything better in the market.
3/9/23, 18:12 - +91 98694 00392: Gold*
3/9/23, 18:14 - +91 97178 23927: Chase Sapphire Premier is another good card worth considering.
3/9/23, 18:15 - +91 98694 00392: Thanks. Will look it up. Got it annual fee?
3/9/23, 18:16 - +91 98694 00392: Got any*
3/9/23, 18:17 - +91 97178 23927: I think it does, would need to check though

3/9/23, 18:29 - +91 97178 23927: Ahh could be yes, heard from friends in US only.
3/9/23, 18:31 - +91 98738 55921: Barclays too. Amex usually is not accepted at many stores in Europe, because of the machine or something not sure why.
3/9/23, 18:32 - +91 98738 55921: You can check.
3/9/23, 18:52 - +91 88618 97183: They charge a higher rate for payments as compared to other providers.
3/9/23, 18:53 - +44 7587 357657: Amex requires each vendor to register with it separately, that's why (as far as I know) as opposed to using the common networks used by other banks

3/9/23, 18:57 - +1 (226) 792-6466: Mostly not accepted because they’re ~1% higher cost than visa/mc

3/10/23, 11:49 - +91 87268 14391: Monzo and Revolut are good. Not sure about the others
3/10/23, 11:55 - +91 87774 05725: Anyone travelling from Manchester to London today ? Needed some help.
3/10/23, 12:23 - +44 7880 364514: I use Monzo, Revolut and Chase. Chase gives 1% cashback

3/10/23, 12:49 - +91 97180 83994: Instead of directly transacting you can convert some amount to EUR and have EUR balance in your revolut account. 
Then when you transact in euro, it will be deducted from that balance.

3/10/23, 12:50 - +44 7880 364514: Plus revolut and monzo/chase have different card issuers. While the former is Visa, the latter ones are Mastercard. Just to keep myself safe, i tend to carry all of them
3/10/23, 12:51 - +44 7880 364514: Yeah but it only makes a difference when you tend to put some money in ur euros account when the rate is high
3/10/23, 12:51 - +44 7880 364514: Otherwise when you are on the go, it doesnt make much of a difference
3/10/23, 12:51 - +91 88618 97183: Check out curve. I've heard good things about adding your credit card there and not having any markup on foreign transactions
3/10/23, 12:52 - +91 88618 97183: You can add credit cards to it. I use the free plan. I haven't seen debit cards being added to that.
3/10/23, 13:19 - +44 7713 957402: Hey, I am selling a spare ticket for Holi celebration event on 12th march. https://www.magicofindia.org/event-details/ 
Let me know if anyone is interested
3/10/23, 13:35 - +91 98738 55921: Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone wants to do a social gathering. We can do it in groups of 15. Good chance to meet people know everyone. 🤗
3/10/23, 13:37 - +44 7769 019377: I'm interested, new here so getting to know people 😅
3/10/23, 13:39 - +44 7379 166516: Please check if AY&J do it, they are a pretty good bunch of solicitors.
3/10/23, 13:39 - +44 7436 038094: Sounds good! We could also do one in summer in a park so more people can come at once too
3/10/23, 13:39 - +44 7379 166516: Then we wait for another 3 months 😜
3/10/23, 13:40 - +44 7436 038094: Haha we could do one that time too
3/10/23, 13:40 - +91 97110 90746: Oh summer, that’s so far away
3/10/23, 13:40 - +44 7436 038094: 15 sounds good for winters
3/10/23, 13:40 - +44 7436 038094: 🥲
3/10/23, 13:59 - +91 84590 80129: How's your experience with dentists in the UK? Is it better to get things done in India?
3/10/23, 14:06 - +44 7379 166516: India is better, didn’t like the dentists here!
3/10/23, 14:06 - +44 7379 166516: Or there services.
3/10/23, 14:07 - +91 95607 72474: India 100%
I have had the worst experience here, she was about to do a treatment without any proper investigation. Saved!
3/10/23, 14:11 - +44 7790 779177: How about indian dentist in Uk?
3/10/23, 14:20 - +91 95607 72474: No such experience. 
But I think waiting to get treated in India is completely worth it. 
*You only realise the value of something when it's gone,*😅
3/10/23, 14:22 - +44 7379 166516: Well said!
3/10/23, 14:22 - +44 7790 779177: But whats the general cost for the appointments here. Because going back to India for multiple appointments would be very costly
3/10/23, 14:23 - +91 95607 72474: I went through NHS and it was an emergency for me. So did not pay.
3/10/23, 14:24 - +91 84590 80129: I'll be having insurance cover.
3/10/23, 14:25 - +44 7790 779177: My parents said generally free stuff is not good 😅
3/10/23, 14:25 - +91 97691 29871: 😂 NHS in London is pretty good if you do get an appointment.
3/10/23, 14:26 - +91 86748 07262: vo log kha gye jo bolte the ki foreign m medical facilities achi hoti h 🤔. Yha toh sb ulta hi h
3/10/23, 14:26 - +91 86748 07262: thats a very big IF bro
3/10/23, 14:26 - +44 7790 779177: The bold part is quoted from the notebooks of people who had breakups recently
3/10/23, 14:27 - +91 95607 72474: Inhi logo ne foreign hype kara h!
3/10/23, 14:28 - +91 86748 07262: dhoka hora h unn indians k sath jin logo ka foreign m settle hona sapna h, just for the sake of better lifestyle. 🥹
3/10/23, 14:29 - +27 81 475 4314: Getting in might be tough but in terms of quality I am sure it would be better . Haven't experienced in UK but in general other countries ke experiences have been much better
3/10/23, 14:30 - +27 81 475 4314: Also, extreme cases main kahan ka ambulace aayega lagta hai 😆😆
3/10/23, 14:30 - +91 86748 07262: india m sbke pass isliye car hoti h, just in case, yha toh parking lot hi afford krna bhari h 😑
3/10/23, 14:30 - +27 81 475 4314: Jokes aside ... minor cases main, yes, it might be difficult, but medical main extreme cases important hote hai
3/10/23, 14:31 - +44 7379 166516: But everyone has paid for NHS!
3/10/23, 14:32 - +27 81 475 4314: Agreed
3/10/23, 14:32 - +44 7379 166516: Equally!
3/10/23, 14:32 - +91 95607 72474: Sorry to say. But my case was a dental emergency. And she was about to do a wrong surgery.
3/10/23, 14:32 - +44 7790 779177: 2nd reason why I don’t have a car. 
1st is I dont have the money
3/10/23, 14:32 - +44 7379 166516: Fuck no 😦
3/10/23, 14:32 - +27 81 475 4314: 🤣🤣
3/10/23, 14:33 - +27 81 475 4314: Trust in Rishi 😆
3/10/23, 14:33 - +91 95607 72474: It’s not free. We pay a bomb.
3/10/23, 14:33 - +91 86748 07262: i just wonder, jinke pass yha car hoti h, unke acount m kch saving hoti bhi h? ya pura paisa car m lga k chalte h
3/10/23, 14:33 - +44 7790 779177: I used believe that it was just for brp card.
3/10/23, 14:33 - +91 86748 07262: <Media omitted>
3/10/23, 14:35 - +27 81 475 4314: Generally monthly payments are cheap and family ho toh make sense ...

Plus outside india they don't believe in saving which is not a smart thing to do
3/10/23, 14:36 - +44 7790 779177: I also have the same doubt. Do they have side business to survive?
3/10/23, 14:37 - +44 7790 779177: We know how to make maggi. Let’s capitalise on it and have side income for cars
3/10/23, 14:39 - +44 7366 440809: Haaa bai
3/10/23, 14:40 - +27 81 475 4314: Bhai rekdi ka bhaada bahut lag jayega
3/10/23, 14:41 - +44 7366 440809: Keeping a car outside london makes a lot of sense if one travels a lot. Itna mushkil nai h as long as you can find a parking spot thatms free or have free parking space where you live
3/10/23, 14:41 - +44 7366 440809: It’s not that difficult to afford, given it’s outside london
3/10/23, 14:44 - +44 7790 779177: Dont worry. I have thought it through. We will implement cloud kitchens and take aways only. Where the driver is also a chef and will go and cook in the clients home
3/10/23, 14:44 - +27 81 475 4314: Haan outside london hi it makes more sense as well. Within city I feel public transport is best option ...
3/10/23, 14:44 - +27 81 475 4314: 🤣 badhiya plan hai
3/10/23, 14:45 - +27 81 475 4314: 20 percent equity kitne main doge ? I would invest in you
3/10/23, 14:52 - +44 7790 779177: Haha. Got my Shark Tank fan buddy. Hows the new season? Thinking of watching this weekend
3/10/23, 14:56 - +91 98738 55921: It's not free, we pay taxes for it. Also a huge amount and never get appointments

3/10/23, 15:07 - +44 7790 779177: I see its like arranged marriage. Initially one doesn’t connect properly. But once they do, they know its the best
3/10/23, 15:08 - +27 81 475 4314: Or they realize they have no option but to accept it 🤣🤣
3/10/23, 15:12 - +44 7790 779177: So what would you do. If you have a invested lot of time in the starting episodes and then you realise that it not going well. Would you cheat for another series or wait for it to get better?
3/10/23, 15:12 - +91 99875 77153: Shall we create a new group for Medical Help & NHS Bitching?
3/10/23, 15:13 - +44 7790 779177: No worries. I will stop now, i was just joking.
3/10/23, 15:15 - +91 99875 77153: I would prefer to keep Medical Help questions in this group. More audience and want people to get help in emergency.
3/10/23, 15:15 - +44 7895 629636: How is the experience with vitality insurance? Do you still need to go via NHS or you can directly consult a private gp/doctor?
3/10/23, 15:16 - +91 88275 24158: If it is a small issue and you want a quick fix.. There are paid hospitals in South hall
3/10/23, 15:17 - +91 88275 24158: Cheaper ones
3/10/23, 15:18 - +27 81 475 4314: Ab aisa lagrai ke marriage counseling ho rahi but using series ke terms 🤣

3/10/23, 16:36 - +44 7895 629636: Ok good to know, thanks.

3/11/23, 12:34 - +91 90133 32219: Keep checking regularly. They keep updating the appointments in case somebody cancels/reschedules. I initially booked for an appointment in May and then rescheduled it to early April.
3/11/23, 12:35 - +91 98246 69998: 10 working days
3/11/23, 12:35 - +44 7502 307298: I’m hoping for that as i need to travel in may !!!
3/11/23, 12:35 - +91 70004 67035: It was processed in 1-2 weeks by the embassy
3/11/23, 12:36 - +44 7435 650262: Really? Thats awfully long, I heard somewhere it’s 2-4 days 😶
3/11/23, 12:36 - +91 70004 67035: I think you will the know result in a few days from website but they will take time to release the passport
3/11/23, 12:37 - +44 7435 650262: Okay, I think you get to know the result on the spot after the interview
3/11/23, 12:38 - +44 7818 250265: Did anyone Apply for any of the short business visa for meetings or is this tourist visa?

And the interview is straightforward 
Just be confident

3/11/23, 13:24 - +91 86978 18442: Think it's not necessary, ymmv. Probably worth always drinking after running for a few seconds
3/11/23, 13:28 - +44 7977 293625: If you have to pick 1 park, it has to be Disneyland park definitely (Walt Disney one is fairly average). And 2 parks in a single day isn’t the best idea according to me, as there is too much to do.
Disneyland park itself is divided into 4 sub parks
3/11/23, 13:40 - +91 86748 07262: Ohh thanks for the insights

3/11/23, 13:49 - +91 97691 29871: Revolut for normal exp and Barclays/HSBC for salary
3/11/23, 13:49 - +91 99798 66829: I would suggest Lloyd’s
3/11/23, 13:49 - +91 97691 29871: You can use the third party apps as well

3/11/23, 18:31 - +44 7824 343230: I did. London to Delhi via UAE last year. They measured all my bags, 2 check in and 1 cabin.
3/11/23, 18:39 - +44 7747 257469: Size doesn’t matter that much but they are very particular about the total weight, that should be strictly less than 30kg
3/11/23, 18:49 - +44 7404 280342: For cabin did they allow a handbag plus a shoulder backpack or something ?
3/11/23, 18:50 - +44 7790 779177: No no size matters. One of my friend had to pay more because it exceeded the dimensions
3/11/23, 18:52 - +44 7790 779177: @447977293625  you remember the Milan airport scene?
3/11/23, 18:54 - +44 7747 257469: In Europe size matters, but not in UAE airports, there weight matters
3/11/23, 18:54 - +44 7790 779177: I see
3/11/23, 19:06 - +44 7465 038006: I have. They didn’t measure but they weighed and opened everyone’s check in suitcase.
3/11/23, 19:44 - +91 80939 26811: Has anyone filled italy visa form.. need some information
3/11/23, 20:03 - +91 79908 06313: For me, they put one of my cabin bags into the check-in luggage because I was overweight by 8 kg on the cabin allowance. I was already overweight by 2kg on the check-in too but they didn't charge me extra at all for anything.
3/11/23, 20:22 - +44 7977 293625: Yeah. Big trolley bags aren’t allowed in cabin
3/11/23, 20:34 - +91 80529 02354: Have one ticket for https://www.magicofindia.org/event-details/ 
Not feeling very well to attend it tomorrow. If anyone wants to buy ?
3/11/23, 20:35 - +44 7747 257469: Nobody weights cabin bag ever until you are carrying a rucksack kind of bags. Not sure how you got caught with cabin bag and that too during check-in time 🤷‍♂️
3/11/23, 20:38 - +44 7388 782650: No, its pretty common with middle-eastern airlines if you are really tight on ur orignal limit of 46 kg , and its only during check-in time , nobody bothers for weight later
3/11/23, 20:42 - +44 7747 257469: I mean cabin bags are mostly behind  your back or if it’s the trolley one that also is not even visible to them during check in time. I have travelled to all the major cities of UAE - Abu dhabi, dubai & sharjah but never faced this thing so was just bit surprised to know tbh.

3/11/23, 22:44 - +44 7442 283248: Hi guys,

This is an incidence I am sharing which happened with me today which I wish doesn't happen to anyone else. I was buying groceries at 4 pm today in broad daylight today, was picking up vegetables today. This guy comes out of nowhere and hits at my chest really hard, so I scream. The lady from inside the shop (whom I am really thankful for) comes out when she hears my groan, I told her that the guy pushed me, then she asks me to check for my phone and wallet. I see they are gone and the guy was just walking, the lady asks me to chase him. I chase him and ask my phone back, almost begging since it was very valuable and had my photos and bank accounts etc. So he starts abusing me "bitch, slut" and says "suck my dick" ... I back off  yet hold my ground, he threatens me with a glass bottle (an attempt to hit me if I don't shut up). I scream "Help! Help!" But everyone was too scared to face the drunk guy. Then a guy with a baby with him says , I'm waiting for the guy to pass because I have baby with me and he calls the police. The police notes down the description and recovers the cctv footage of the maniac where he's seen snatching my phone and passing it to his partner who then fled away with it. There's nothing anyone can do in this situation... Had it been anyone else... Just be safe guys...
3/11/23, 22:48 - +44 7442 283248: Try to go in groups for shopping whenever possible

3/11/23, 23:05 - +44 7341 486161: whoops
3/11/23, 23:51 - +91 90047 09360: If you're looking for Indian street food, go to this place called Rekdi pani puri (https://goo.gl/maps/qqz4W8zvc6zXD2767). There are two shops nearby and are quite affordable (by London standards)
3/12/23, 00:58 - +91 82965 38870: I'm so sorry to hear this and pls let me know if there's anything I can help you with. Theft is turning out to be quite common sadly. Take care x
3/12/23, 01:17 - +91 85286 84450: take care @447442283248. It's sad that such things happen in a city like london. 😔
3/12/23, 02:21 - +44 7895 629636: Sad incident. Unfortunately these things still happen here.
3/12/23, 02:29 - +44 7983 735999: I'm glad you're safe. But honestly, if something like this happens to anyone. Confront but do not push it. Guys like those don't hesitate to stab if need be. Speaking from experience. We were in a group and there was only 1 guy with schizophrenia threatened us with a knife just because he thought we were laughing at him (we smiled and nodded as a greeting and being polite) luckily he had a frnd who dragged him off cuz there were guards around.

I'm glad you're safe
3/12/23, 03:02 - +44 7442 283248: Thank you so much ❣️ I'll remember that
3/12/23, 05:20 - +91 94540 05181 added +91 90858 12130
3/12/23, 08:59 - +91 98694 00392: Yup, I did. I booked Business class refundable directly from website. It’s 100% refundable. Don’t pay via credit card as it has some non refundable charges. Got it confirmed from the customer service.
3/12/23, 09:10 - +91 98694 00392: This is so wrong and scary. And more so it happened when others were around. Isn’t there a women’s  helpline number that could be of more help?

I also saw a guy coming to another person asking for money in a very aggressive way. I shouted at that guy so he took off. I also wondered what I would have done if something like that happened to me. 
I felt the best option was to run and try going towards a crowd may be? Not sure if physically engaging would be the best option here.
3/12/23, 09:17 - +91 98186 93845: @447442283248 I hope you are okay and feeling safe now 💕 If you need anything please let me know
3/12/23, 09:17 - +91 96505 97515: Sorry to hear it.

The cops got the guy on cctv right? Do they seem like they'll take it seriously given that this is assault and not just pickpocketing?
3/12/23, 09:20 - +91 94286 61452: I am not sure if legal but is keeping a pepper spray or electic shock stick an option?
3/12/23, 09:21 - +91 94286 61452: I see on Amazon it's being sold so could be legal only
3/12/23, 09:23 - +44 7423 210151: Sad to hear this happen but also glad that you are ok .. it could had been way worse. Given the deteriorating economic and law/order situation here, better to stay vigilant .. such antisocial elements target Indians knowing that they will find something valuable.
3/12/23, 09:27 - +44 7405 367004: It's illegal, using pepper spray
3/12/23, 09:28 - +91 98738 55921: But stealing is legal? 🥲
3/12/23, 09:33 - +91 99875 01364: We can't keep pepper spray..
3/12/23, 09:42 - +44 7405 367004: It isn't too but keeping a pepper spray will make you equal to any offence committed
3/12/23, 09:43 - +44 7405 367004: Best is to call the police and follow- up with them on the situation
3/12/23, 09:54 - +44 7917 925526: Similar incident happened with my wife last week... Bag stolen in the blink of an eye at Zara store.... The store guys not et all helpful
3/12/23, 09:57 - +91 98875 43118: Which area?
3/12/23, 09:59 - +44 7917 925526: Oxford Street
3/12/23, 10:00 - +91 86748 07262: Very sad
3/12/23, 10:01 - +44 7444 584832: Happens very often at Oxford Street
3/12/23, 10:01 - +44 7444 584832: Got my phone snatched by a biker there
3/12/23, 10:01 - +44 7917 925526: That's what store guys also told us...
3/12/23, 10:17 - +44 7549 326830: My phone got stolen in the same Zara store at Oxford!!
It’s really helpless here becoz police will register complaint and do nothing even after getting the offender on cctv
3/12/23, 10:19 - +44 7444 584832: True
3/12/23, 10:25 - +44 7895 629636: Same thing happened to my girlfriend as well, her hand bag got stolen at zara store from oxford street. The store refused to share cctc footage without police, police refused to go to the store to investigate. 
Pathetic.
3/12/23, 10:26 - +44 7917 925526: Same....
3/12/23, 10:26 - +44 7895 629636: And keeping pepper spray is illegal 😂. All hail England.
3/12/23, 10:30 - Hemant Panchabhai UK Concerts: Beware of KOKO club as well. One of my friends jacket was stolen most likely by the cloakroom staff. The manager/owner refused to do anything about it. The police said it's not worth their time.
3/12/23, 10:30 - +44 7405 367004: Where do we keep our phone and wallet when at Oxford Street? What I do generally, I hang my bag inside my overcoat, so it is not visible from the outside. Even if anyone tries to snatch it, they won't be able to cz of the body weight. I always followed this. Try it girls!
3/12/23, 10:33 - +44 7405 367004: I will speak to a police officer regarding that, and ask them about the alternatives. Don't worry. Will update here soon.
3/12/23, 10:36 - +44 7895 629636: Turns out some things are legal to carry, like:

3/12/23, 10:59 - +44 7502 072354: The staff at KOKO is the worst. They are not helpful at all. My purse was stolen literally from my shoulder and I immediately went to ask for help and they said come back when the club is closing???

3/12/23, 11:17 - +44 7483 138662: While applying for Schengen visa from Italy, is there any suggestion/trick to get a long term multiple trip visa?
3/12/23, 11:20 - +44 7747 257469: Show multiple trips with 1 month itinerary with lot of cash 💵 in your bank account and a good cover letter would increase your chances!
3/12/23, 11:21 - +91 90512 86931: Anyone watching India Australia match?
3/12/23, 11:21 - +91 80101 55737: This offer is still valid
3/12/23, 11:25 - +91 88618 97183: I'm so sorry this happened and I hope you're okay. Just bookmarked a link yesterday so sharing it with everyone in case it's helpful. 

This is no solution but atleast preparation for worst case.

3/12/23, 12:19 - +91 98694 00392: Try getting a letter from work which says you have to attend work meetings and request to grant 1 year Multi entry visa.

3/12/23, 19:07 - +91 86748 07262: I think it should be straightforward. It totally depends on your insurance provider

3/12/23, 19:33 - Hemant Panchabhai UK Concerts: Yeah, coupon was there. They didn’t let us check the cloakroom or cctv footage. Totally sketchy behaviour.

Don't do it
3/12/23, 19:59 - +91 88618 97183: An alternative is the share code for right to work or right to rent 

Not sure what your use case is but the system is designed such that you don't have to share your BRP Details
